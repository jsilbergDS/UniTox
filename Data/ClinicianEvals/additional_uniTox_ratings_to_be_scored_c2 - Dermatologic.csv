Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors. Physicians should discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION among the general population in patients with a “crowded” optic disc, although evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitor, including STENDRA, for these uncommon conditions.
