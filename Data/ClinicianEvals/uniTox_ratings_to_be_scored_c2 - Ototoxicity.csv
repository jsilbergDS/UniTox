QUININE SULFATE,"### Summary of Ototoxicity and Auditory Risks for QUALAQUIN (Quinine Sulfate)
 

 1. **Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1)**
  - **Cinchonism Symptoms**: The drug itself is associated with a cluster of symptoms called ""cinchonism,"" which includes tinnitus, hearing impairment, and deafness. These symptoms occur to some degree in almost all patients taking quinine.
  - **Severe Cinchonism**: The drug itself can cause more severe symptoms of cinchonism, such as deafness and blindness.
  - **Special Senses**: The drug itself has been reported to cause visual disturbances, including blurred vision, sudden loss of vision, photophobia, diplopia, night blindness, diminished visual fields, fixed pupillary dilatation, disturbed color vision, optic neuritis, blindness, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing impairment, and deafness.
 

 2. **Overdosage (Section 10)**
  - **Cinchonism in Overdose**: The drug itself, when overdosed, can cause cinchonism symptoms, which include tinnitus, vertigo, hearing impairment, and deafness.
 

 3. **Clinical Pharmacology (Section 12.3)**
  - **Distribution**: The drug itself penetrates relatively poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with cerebral malaria, with CSF concentration approximately 2 to 7% of plasma concentration. This indicates that while the drug does reach the CSF, it does so in limited amounts, which may be relevant to its ototoxic effects.
 

 4. **Nonclinical Toxicology (Section 13.1)**
  - **Animal Studies**: The drug itself, in animal studies, has shown increased rates of degenerated auditory nerve and spiral ganglion in rabbit offspring at certain doses. This suggests a potential ototoxic effect of the drug itself in animal models.
 

 ### Conclusion
 QUALAQUIN (quinine sulfate) is associated with several ototoxic risks and auditory reactions, primarily through the symptoms of cinchonism, which include tinnitus, hearing impairment, and deafness. These effects are noted both in typical therapeutic use and in cases of overdose. Additionally, animal studies have indicated potential ototoxic effects, further supporting the association of the drug itself with auditory risks.",Most,Yes,1,1,,
