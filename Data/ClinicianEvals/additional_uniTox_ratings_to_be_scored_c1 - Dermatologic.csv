TOXICOLOGY SALIVA COLLECTION KIT,"The drug label for the Toxicology Saliva Collection Kit, which includes ibuprofen, discusses several dermatological and cutaneous risks and reactions associated with the drug. Here is a summary of those parts:
 

 1. **Skin Reactions (WARNINGS section)**:
  - **Serious Skin Adverse Events**: The label states that NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. This indicates that ibuprofen itself is associated with these serious skin reactions.
  - **Occurrence Without Warning**: These serious events may occur without warning, suggesting that patients should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of skin reactions while using ibuprofen.
 

 2. **Adverse Reactions (DERMATOLOGIC section)**:
  - **Common Reactions**: The label lists rash (including maculopapular type) and pruritus as reactions occurring in 3% to 9% of patients treated with ibuprofen. This indicates that ibuprofen itself is associated with these common dermatological reactions.
  - **Less Common Reactions**: Vesiculobullous eruptions, urticaria, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and alopecia are listed as less common reactions with a probable causal relationship to ibuprofen. This suggests that ibuprofen itself is associated with these less frequent but serious dermatological reactions.
  - **Rare Reactions**: Toxic epidermal necrolysis and photoallergic skin reactions are mentioned as rare reactions with a probable causal relationship to ibuprofen. This indicates that ibuprofen itself is associated with these rare but severe skin reactions.
 

 3. **Information for Patients**:
  - **Serious Skin Side Effects**: Patients are informed that ibuprofen, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. This reinforces that ibuprofen itself is associated with these serious skin risks.
  - **Signs and Symptoms**: Patients are advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and to seek medical advice if these occur. This indicates that ibuprofen itself can cause these symptoms and that patients should discontinue use and contact their physician if they develop any type of rash.
 

 In summary, the drug label clearly associates ibuprofen with a range of dermatological and cutaneous risks, from common reactions like rash and pruritus to serious and potentially fatal conditions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.",Most,Yes,1,1,,

METHYLPHENIDATE,"### Summary of Dermatological and Cutaneous Risks and Reactions for DAYTRANA
 

 1. **Chemical Leukoderma**:
  - **Summary**: DAYTRANA use may result in a persistent loss of skin pigmentation at and around the application site. In some cases, loss of pigmentation has been reported at other sites distant from the application site. 
  - **Association**: The drug itself is associated with causing chemical leukoderma.
 

 2. **Contact Sensitization**:
  - **Summary**: Use of DAYTRANA may lead to contact sensitization. Erythema is commonly seen with use of DAYTRANA and is not by itself an indication of sensitization. However, contact sensitization should be suspected if erythema is accompanied by a more intense local reaction (edema, papules, vesicles) that does not significantly improve within 48 hours or spreads beyond the transdermal system site.
  - **Association**: The drug itself is associated with causing contact sensitization.
 

 3. **Skin Irritation and Application Site Reactions**:
  - **Summary**: DAYTRANA is a dermal irritant. The majority of subjects in clinical studies had minimal to definite skin erythema at the transdermal system application site. This erythema generally caused no or minimal discomfort and did not usually interfere with therapy or result in discontinuation from treatment.
  - **Association**: The drug itself is associated with causing skin irritation and application site reactions.
 

 4. **Adverse Reactions in Clinical Studies with Discontinuation of Treatment**:
  - **Summary**: In clinical studies, the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was application site reactions.
  - **Association**: The drug itself is associated with causing application site reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment.
 

 5. **Postmarketing Experience**:
  - **Summary**: Application site reactions such as bleeding, bruising, burn, burning, dermatitis, discharge, discoloration, discomfort, dryness, eczema, edema, erosion, erythema, excoriation, exfoliation, fissure, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, induration, infection, inflammation, irritation, pain, papules, paresthesia, pruritus, rash, scab, swelling, ulcer, urticaria, vesicles, and warmth have been reported.
  - **Association**: The drug itself is associated with causing a wide range of application site reactions.
 

 6. **Instructions for Use**:
  - **Summary**: Patients or caregivers should not apply hydrocortisone or other solutions, creams, ointments, or emollients immediately prior to DAYTRANA application, since the effect on transdermal system adhesion and methylphenidate absorption has not been established.
  - **Association**: This is a precaution related to the drug's application, not a direct dermatological risk caused by the drug itself.
 

 7. **Medication Guide**:
  - **Summary**: DAYTRANA may cause skin problems where it is applied (redness, small bumps, itching). If any swelling or blistering occurs, the DAYTRANA should not be worn, and the patient should be seen by the prescriber.
  - **Association**: The drug itself is associated with causing skin problems at the application site.
 

 8. **Allergic Skin Rash (Contact Sensitization)**:
  - **Summary**: Stop using DAYTRANA and tell your child's healthcare provider right away if your child develops swelling or blisters at or around the application site. Your child may have a skin allergy to DAYTRANA.
  - **Association**: The drug itself is associated with causing allergic skin rash and contact sensitization.
 

 ### Conclusion
 DAYTRANA is associated with several dermatological and cutaneous risks, including chemical leukoderma, contact sensitization, skin irritation, and a variety of application site reactions. These reactions can range from mild erythema to more severe conditions such as swelling, blistering, and persistent loss of skin pigmentation. Patients are advised to monitor for these reactions and consult their healthcare provider if they occur.",Most,Yes,1,1,,

 1. **Premarketing Trials**:
  - **Association**: About 5% of patients developed rash and/or urticaria during premarketing trials with ziprasidone.
  - **Details**: Discontinuation of treatment occurred in about one-sixth of these cases. The occurrence of rash was related to the dose of ziprasidone, although this might also be explained by longer exposure time in higher dose patients. Several patients with rash had signs and symptoms of associated systemic illness, e.g., elevated WBCs.
