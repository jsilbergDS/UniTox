TEMSIROLIMUS,"The drug label for TORISEL (temsirolimus) discusses infertility risks in the following sections:
 

 1. **Section 5.15 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:**
  - **Summary:** This section does not directly discuss infertility but mentions that TORISEL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It advises females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. This implies a need for caution regarding reproductive health but does not directly state infertility risks.
 

 2. **Section 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:**
  - **Contraception:**
  - **Summary:** This subsection advises females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TORISEL and for 3 months after the last dose. It also advises males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. This is a precautionary measure to prevent fetal harm, not directly related to infertility.
  - **Infertility:**
  - **Summary:** This subsection explicitly states that based on findings in animal fertility studies, male and female fertility may be compromised by the treatment with TORISEL. It is not known if the effects on fertility in animal studies were reversible. This directly associates TORISEL with potential infertility risks.
 

 3. **Section 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:**
  - **Summary:** This section provides details from animal studies. In male rats, decreased number of pregnancies, decreased sperm concentration and motility, decreased reproductive organ weights, and testicular tubular degeneration were observed at doses ≥3 mg/m²/day (approximately 0.2-fold the human recommended intravenous dose). Fertility was absent at 30 mg/m²/day. In female rats, an increased incidence of pre- and post-implantation losses occurred at doses ≥4.2 mg/m²/day (approximately 0.3-fold the human recommended intravenous dose), resulting in decreased numbers of live fetuses. This section directly associates TORISEL with infertility risks in both male and female animals.
 

 In summary, the drug label indicates that TORISEL itself is associated with potential infertility risks based on animal studies, showing compromised fertility in both male and female rats. The label advises the use of contraception to prevent fetal harm but does not directly link this precaution to infertility.",Most,Yes,1,1,,
