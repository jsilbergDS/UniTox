FOSPHENYTOIN SODIUM,"### Summary of Dermatological and Cutaneous Risks and Reactions for CEREBYX
 

 1. **Serious Dermatologic Reactions**:
  - **CEREBYX can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs)**, which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin (the active metabolite of CEREBYX)-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days but can occur later. **CEREBYX should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash**, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs.
 

 2. **HLA-B*1502 and CYP2C9*3 Variants**:
  - Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that **HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin**. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding CEREBYX as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers. Should CEREBYX be utilized for CYP2C9*3 carriers, consider starting at the lower end of the dosage range.
 

 3. **Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity**:
  - **Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin and CEREBYX**. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. **CEREBYX should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established**.
 

 4. **Hypersensitivity**:
  - **CEREBYX and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity**. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to CEREBYX.
 

 5. **Angioedema**:
  - **Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin and CEREBYX in the postmarketing setting**. **CEREBYX should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur**. **CEREBYX should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established**.
 

 6. **Clinical Trials Experience**:
  - The adverse reactions most commonly observed with the use of CEREBYX in clinical trials were nystagmus, dizziness, pruritus, somnolence, and ataxia. With one exception, these reactions are commonly associated with the administration of IV phenytoin. **Pruritus, however, was seen much more often following CEREBYX administration and occurred more often with IV CEREBYX administration than with IM CEREBYX administration**. These reactions were dose and rate related; most alert patients (41 of 64; 64%) administered doses of ≥15 mg PE/kg at 150 mg PE/min experienced discomfort of some degree. These sensations, generally described as itching, burning, or tingling, were usually not at the infusion site. The location of the discomfort varied with the groin mentioned most frequently as a site of involvement. The paresthesia and pruritus were transient events that occurred within several minutes of the start of infusion and generally resolved within 10 minutes after completion of CEREBYX infusion. Some patients experienced symptoms for hours. These reactions did not increase in severity with repeated administration. Concurrent adverse events or clinical laboratory change suggesting an allergic process were not seen.
 

 7. **Postmarketing Experience**:
  - The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of phenytoin or fosphenytoin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. **Body as a Whole: Anaphylaxis, angioedema**.
