INSULIN GLARGINE-AGLR,"The drug label for REZVOGLAR (insulin glargine-aglr) does not explicitly mention hematological toxicity risks or hematological reactions. The label primarily focuses on the risks and adverse reactions associated with hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity reactions, hypokalemia, and other non-hematological issues. 
 

 Here is a summary of the relevant sections that might indirectly relate to hematological aspects, but none of these explicitly state hematological toxicity:
 

 1. **Hypoglycemia**: The label mentions that hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including insulin glargine products. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. This is not directly a hematological toxicity but rather a metabolic issue.
 

 2. **Hypokalemia**: The label states that all insulins, including insulin glargine products, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. This is an electrolyte imbalance rather than a direct hematological toxicity.
 

 3. **Hypersensitivity Reactions**: The label mentions that severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including insulin glargine products. This includes systemic reactions such as generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock. These are immune-mediated reactions rather than direct hematological toxicities.
 

 4. **Fluid Retention and Heart Failure**: The label notes that thiazolidinediones (TZDs), when used in combination with insulin, can cause dose-related fluid retention, which may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. This is more related to cardiovascular and fluid balance issues rather than hematological toxicity.
