NORETHINDRONE,"The drug label for ORTHO MICRONOR® (norethindrone) discusses infertility risks in several sections. Here is a summary of those parts, clearly stating whether the drug itself was associated with or caused the infertility risk:
 

 1. **Delayed Follicular Atresia/Ovarian Cysts**:
  - **Summary**: The label mentions that if follicular development occurs, atresia of the follicle is sometimes delayed, and the follicle may continue to grow beyond its normal size. These enlarged follicles generally disappear spontaneously and are often asymptomatic, but in rare cases, they may twist or rupture, requiring surgical intervention.
  - **Association with Drug**: The drug is associated with the risk of delayed follicular atresia and ovarian cysts, but it does not explicitly state that the drug causes infertility.
 

 2. **Ectopic Pregnancy**:
  - **Summary**: The incidence of ectopic pregnancies for progestin-only oral contraceptive users is 5 per 1000 woman-years. Up to 10% of pregnancies reported in clinical studies of progestin-only oral contraceptive users are extrauterine. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain while on progestin-only oral contraceptives.
  - **Association with Drug**: The drug is associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, which can impact fertility, but it does not explicitly state that the drug causes infertility.
 

 3. **Fertility Following Discontinuation**:
  - **Summary**: The limited available data indicate a rapid return of normal ovulation and fertility following discontinuation of progestin-only oral contraceptives.
  - **Association with Drug**: The drug is not associated with long-term infertility. Fertility is expected to return rapidly after discontinuation.
 

 4. **Cancer of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts**:
  - **Summary**: Some studies in women who use combined oral contraceptives that contain both estrogen and a progestin have reported an increase in the risk of developing breast cancer, particularly at a younger age and apparently related to the duration of use. There is insufficient data to determine whether the use of POPs similarly increases this risk.
  - **Association with Drug**: The drug is not explicitly associated with causing infertility due to cancer of the reproductive organs and breasts. The risk is mentioned in the context of combined oral contraceptives, and there is insufficient data for progestin-only pills.
 

 5. **General Precautions**:
  - **Summary**: Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.
  - **Association with Drug**: This statement does not discuss infertility risks directly related to the drug.
 

 In summary, the drug label for ORTHO MICRONOR® (norethindrone) associates the drug with risks of delayed follicular atresia, ovarian cysts, and ectopic pregnancy, which can impact fertility.
