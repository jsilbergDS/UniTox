This indicates that abacavir was associated with an increase in CD4+ cell count, which is a positive hematological outcome.
   - **CNA3005**: 
     - Through Week 48, an overall mean increase in CD4+ cell count of about 150 cells per mm³ was observed in both treatment arms. This indicates that abacavir was associated with an increase in CD4+ cell count, which is a positive hematological outcome.
   - **CNA30021**: 
     - After 48 weeks of therapy, the median CD4+ cell count increases from baseline were 188 cells per mm³ in the group receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily and 200 cells per mm³ in the group receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily.

CORTICORELIN OVINE TRIFLUTATE,"The drug label for ACTHREL® (corticorelin ovine triflutate for injection) does not explicitly mention hematological toxicity risks or hematological reactions. The label primarily focuses on the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, indications, usage, contraindications, precautions, adverse reactions, and administration of the drug. 

Here is a summary of the relevant sections that might indirectly relate to hematological concerns, although they do not specifically address hematological toxicity:

1. **Adverse Reactions**:
   - Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, wheezing, and angioedema. These reactions are not specifically hematological but are immune responses that could potentially involve hematological components.
   - Higher doses (>3 mcg/kg) are associated with more prolonged flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, dyspnea, and ""chest compression"" or tightness. These are cardiovascular and respiratory reactions, not directly hematological.

2. **Precautions**:
   - The severity of adverse effects appears to be dose-dependent, with higher doses associated with transient tachycardia, decreased blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and asystole. These are cardiovascular effects, not hematological.
   - Hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria and angioedema, which involve immune responses but are not specifically hematological toxicity.

3. **Drug Interactions**:
   - The use of heparin solution to maintain i.v. cannula patency during the corticorelin test is not recommended due to a possible interaction that may cause a major hypotensive reaction. This interaction is more related to cardiovascular effects rather than hematological toxicity.

4. **Contraindications**:
   - ACTHREL is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to ovine corticorelin or any of its excipients. Hypersensitivity reactions can involve various systems, including hematological components, but the label does not specify hematological toxicity.

In summary, the drug label does not provide specific information on hematological toxicity risks or reactions directly caused by ACTHREL®. The adverse reactions and precautions mentioned are primarily related to hypersensitivity, cardiovascular, and respiratory effects.",No,No,1,1,

OXYMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE,"The provided drug label for OPANA (oxymorphone hydrochloride) does not explicitly mention hematological toxicity risks or hematological reactions. The label primarily focuses on the drug's indications, dosage, administration, contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, drug interactions, use in specific populations, drug abuse and dependence, overdosage, and clinical pharmacology.

However, for completeness, here is a summary of the relevant sections that might indirectly relate to hematological concerns:

1. **Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1)**:
   - The label lists various adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, but none are specifically hematological in nature. The common adverse reactions include nausea, pyrexia, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, headache, dizziness, constipation, and confusion. These reactions are associated with the drug itself.

2. **Drug Interactions (Section 7.1)**:
   - The label mentions that the concomitant use of OPANA with other CNS depressants can produce additive CNS depressant effects, including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma, and death. This is related to the drug itself but does not specifically mention hematological toxicity.

3. **Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.1)**:
   - The label discusses the potential risks of using OPANA during pregnancy, including possible fetal harm based on animal data. It mentions decreased fetal and pup weights, an increase in stillbirth, and a decrease in postnatal pup survival. These effects are associated with the drug itself but are not specifically hematological.

4. **Nonclinical Toxicology (Section 13.1)**:
   - The label includes information on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility. It mentions that oxymorphone hydrochloride tested positive in both the rat and mouse in vivo micronucleus assays, indicating an increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. This suggests a potential genotoxic effect associated with the drug itself, which could be considered a hematological concern.

Here is a summary of the relevant sections that might indirectly relate to hematological concerns, although they do not specifically mention hematological toxicity or reactions:

1. **Warnings and Precautions:**
   - **Potential Risk of Osteosarcoma:** NATPARA is associated with an increased risk of osteosarcoma in animal studies, and this risk cannot be excluded in humans.
   - **Hypercalcemia:** NATPARA can cause severe hypercalcemia, which requires monitoring and management.
   - **Hypocalcemia:** Severe hypocalcemia can occur if NATPARA is interrupted or discontinued abruptly.
   - **Risk of Digoxin Toxicity:** Hypercalcemia due to NATPARA can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity.
   - **Hypersensitivity:** NATPARA has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and rash.

2. **Adverse Reactions:**
   - **Clinical Trials:** The most common adverse reactions associated with NATPARA include paresthesia, hypocalcemia, headache, hypercalcemia, nausea, hypoesthesia, diarrhea, vomiting, arthralgia, hypercalciuria, and pain in extremity. There is no mention of hematological toxicity or reactions.
   - **Immunogenicity:** NATPARA may trigger the development of antibodies, but this is not directly related to hematological toxicity.

3. **Postmarketing Experience:**
   - **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Post-approval use of NATPARA has identified hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and rash. These are not hematological reactions.

In summary, the drug label for NATPARA does not provide information on hematological toxicity risks or hematological reactions directly associated with the drug.

PERPHENAZINE,"### Summary of Hematological Toxicity Risks and Reactions for Perphenazine

1. **Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis:**
   - **Association/Cause:** Events of leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing experience with antipsychotic agents, including perphenazine.
   - **Details:** Patients with preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy. Perphenazine should be discontinued at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm³) should discontinue perphenazine and have their WBC followed until recovery.

2. **Hematological Effects:**
   - **Association/Cause:** Perphenazine has been associated with agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and pancytopenia.
   - **Details:** Most cases of agranulocytosis have occurred between the fourth and tenth weeks of therapy.
