ATORVASTATIN,"The drug label for Atorvastatin Calcium does not explicitly mention pulmonary toxicity risks or pulmonary reactions in the sections provided. However, it does include a general warning about interstitial lung disease, which is a type of pulmonary condition. Here is a summary of the relevant information:

1. **Interstitial Lung Disease**:
   - **Sentence**: ""Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin calcium therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: ... interstitial lung disease.""
   - **Summary**: Interstitial lung disease has been reported in association with atorvastatin calcium therapy. The label does not definitively state that the drug causes this condition but notes it as a reported adverse reaction.

In summary, the drug label mentions interstitial lung disease as a reported adverse reaction associated with atorvastatin calcium therapy, but it does not provide detailed information on pulmonary toxicity risks or other specific pulmonary reactions directly caused by the drug.",Less,Yes,1,2,,
BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE,"The drug label for QNASL (beclomethasone dipropionate) Nasal Aerosol does not explicitly mention pulmonary toxicity risks or pulmonary reactions. The primary focus of the warnings and precautions sections is on local nasal effects, eye disorders, hypersensitivity reactions, immunosuppression, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis effects, and effects on growth. 

Here is a summary of the relevant sections that might indirectly relate to pulmonary concerns:

1. **Warnings and Precautions (5.4 Immunosuppression)**:
   - **Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex**: This section mentions that corticosteroids, including QNASL, can worsen existing infections, which could potentially include respiratory infections. However, it does not specifically state that QNASL causes pulmonary toxicity.
   - **More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients**: This implies that patients on QNASL may have a more severe course of these infections, which can affect the lungs, but it does not directly state that QNASL causes pulmonary toxicity.

2. **Adverse Reactions (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience)**:
   - **Upper respiratory tract infection**: In children aged 4 to 11 years, upper respiratory tract infections were reported as a common adverse reaction. This indicates an association with the drug but does not confirm causation of pulmonary toxicity.

3. **Adverse Reactions (6.2 Postmarketing Experience)**:
   - **Bronchospasm**: This reaction has been reported following the oral inhalation of beclomethasone dipropionate, which is a different formulation than QNASL Nasal Aerosol. This suggests a potential risk but does not confirm that QNASL Nasal Aerosol itself causes bronchospasm or pulmonary toxicity.

In summary, while there are mentions of respiratory-related adverse reactions and the potential for worsening infections that could affect the lungs, the drug label does not explicitly state that QNASL Nasal Aerosol causes pulmonary toxicity. The associations are more indirect and related to the general effects of corticosteroids on the immune system and infections.",Less,No,1,1,,Is pulmonary infection a pulmonary toxicity? steroids can potentially increase risk of pulmonary infection through supressing the immune system.
