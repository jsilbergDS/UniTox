INDOCYANINE GREEN,"The drug label for SPY AGENT GREEN does not explicitly discuss infertility risks. Here is a summary of the relevant sections that might indirectly relate to reproductive health, but none of these sections directly associate the drug with infertility risks:
 

 1. **Pregnancy (8.1)**:
  - **Summary**: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SPY AGENT GREEN in pregnant women. Available data from a very small number of scientific literature studies with indocyanine green use in pregnant women over several decades have not reported any drug-associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Data from one small study in which indocyanine green was administered intravenously to pregnant women during labor suggest there is no placental transfer of the drug. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with indocyanine green.
  - **Infertility Risk**: The drug itself was not associated with or caused infertility risk.
 

 2. **Lactation (8.2)**:
  - **Summary**: Seventeen cases of indocyanine green use in lactating women have been reported in the scientific literature with no adverse events observed in the breastfed infant. However, there are no data on the presence of indocyanine green in human milk or the effects on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SPY AGENT GREEN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SPY AGENT GREEN or from the underlying maternal condition.
  - **Infertility Risk**: The drug itself was not associated with or caused infertility risk.
 

 3. **Pediatric Use (8.4)**:
  - **Summary**: Use of SPY AGENT GREEN for visualization of vessels, blood flow, and tissue perfusion has been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month and older. Pediatric use is supported by published data in 49 pediatric patients who received indocyanine green for assessment of blood flow and tissue perfusion in cardiovascular, vascular, plastic, micro- and reconstructive surgical procedures, and by clinical trials in adults. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between pediatric patients and adults. The dose range was similar to the effective dose range in adults. The use of SPY AGENT GREEN for visualization of vessels, blood flow, and tissue perfusion has not been established in pediatric patients aged less than 1 month.
  - **Infertility Risk**: The drug itself was not associated with or caused infertility risk.
 

 4. **Geriatric Use (8.5)**:
  - **Summary**: Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of SPY AGENT GREEN in visualization of vessels, blood flow, and tissue perfusion, 7% were 65 and over, while 1% were 75 and over. Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of SPY AGENT GREEN in visualization of lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels during lymphatic mapping of cervical and uterine cancer, 9% were 65 and over, while 2% were 75 and over. Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of SPY AGENT GREEN in visualization of lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels during lymphatic mapping of breast cancer, 38% were 65 and over, while 8% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. Clinical studies of SPY AGENT GREEN in visualization of extrahepatic biliary ducts did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
