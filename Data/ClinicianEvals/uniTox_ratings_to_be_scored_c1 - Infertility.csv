HALOPERIDOL,"The drug label for Haloperidol Injection, USP, discusses infertility risks in the following sections:
 

 1. **Usage in Pregnancy**:
  - ""Rats or rabbits administered oral haloperidol at doses of 0.5 to 7.5 mg/kg, which are approximately 0.2 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day based on mg/m² body surface area, showed an increase in incidence of resorption, reduced fertility, delayed delivery and pup mortality.""
  - **Summary**: Haloperidol itself was associated with reduced fertility in animal studies (rats or rabbits).
 

 2. **Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**:
  - ""No mutagenic potential of haloperidol was found in the Ames Salmonella assay. Negative or inconsistent positive findings have been obtained in in vitro and in vivo studies of effects of haloperidol on chromosome structure and number. The available cytogenetic evidence is considered too inconsistent to be conclusive at this time.""
  - **Summary**: Haloperidol itself was not conclusively associated with mutagenic potential based on inconsistent findings.
  - ""Carcinogenicity studies using oral haloperidol were conducted in Wistar rats (dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily for 24 months) and in Albino Swiss mice (dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily for 18 months). In the rat study survival was reduced in all dose groups, decreasing the number of rats at risk for developing tumors. However, although a relatively greater number of rats survived to the end of the study in high-dose male and female groups, these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors than control animals. Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of a haloperidol related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at doses up to approximately 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day based on mg/m² body surface area.""
  - **Summary**: Haloperidol itself was not associated with an increased incidence of tumors in rats.

In male mice, no statistically significant differences in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted.""
  - **Summary**: Haloperidol itself was associated with an increased incidence of mammary gland and pituitary gland tumors in female mice.
  - ""Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients.""
  - **Summary**: Haloperidol itself was associated with elevated prolactin levels, which may be important for patients with breast cancer, but the clinical significance of this elevation is unknown.
  - ""An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.""
  - **Summary**: Haloperidol itself was associated with an increase in mammary neoplasms in rodents, but no conclusive evidence in humans.

  - **Summary**: ""Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.""
  - **Infertility Risk**: The drug itself is not associated with or stated to cause infertility. The label indicates a lack of data on pediatric use.
 

 5. **Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.5 - Geriatric Use)**:
  - **Summary**: ""Clinical studies of phenylephrine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.""
  - **Infertility Risk**: The drug itself is not associated with or stated to cause infertility. The label focuses on dose selection and response in elderly patients.
 

 6. **Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.6 - Hepatic Impairment)**:
  - **Summary**: ""In patients with liver cirrhosis [Child Pugh Class A (n=3), Class B (n=5) and Class C (n=1)], dose-response data indicate decreased responsiveness to phenylephrine. Consider using larger doses than usual in hepatic impaired subjects.""
  - **Infertility Risk**: The drug itself is not associated with or stated to cause infertility. The label discusses dose adjustments for hepatic impairment.
 

 7. **Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.7 - Renal Impairment)**:
  - **Summary**: ""In patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis, dose-response data indicates increased responsiveness to phenylephrine. Consider using lower doses of phenylephrine hydrochloride in ESRD patients.""
  - **Infertility Risk**: The drug itself is not associated with or stated to cause infertility. The label discusses dose adjustments for renal impairment.
