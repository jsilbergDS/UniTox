75,ATENOLOL,"1. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: The drug label mentions that in patients with acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly in atenolol-treated patients than in control patients, which is expected for any beta-blocker. These reactions usually responded to atropine and/or withholding further dosage of atenolol. The incidence of heart failure was not increased by atenolol. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

2. **Cardiotoxicity Reactions**: In a study of patients with acute myocardial infarction, the following adverse events were reported during intravenous and/or oral atenolol administration: bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, heart failure, heart block, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrests, cardiogenic shock, and other cardiac events. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity reactions.)

3. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: The drug label also mentions that in controlled clinical trials, atenolol was effective as an antihypertensive agent providing 24-hour reduction of blood pressure. However, it is noted that continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over time can lead to cardiac failure in some cases. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately, and if cardiac failure continues despite adequate treatment, atenolol should be withdrawn. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

4. **Cardiotoxicity Reactions**: The label further states that in patients with coronary artery disease being treated with atenolol, abrupt discontinuation of therapy should be avoided to prevent severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias. Patients should be carefully observed, and if angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, atenolol should be promptly reinstituted. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity reactions.)

5. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: Additionally, the drug label warns that in patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued use of beta-blockers like atenolol over time can lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately, and if cardiac failure persists despite treatment, atenolol should be withdrawn. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

6. **Cardiotoxicity Reactions**: The label also cautions about the concomitant use of calcium channel blockers with atenolol, which can lead to bradycardia, heart block, and increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Patients with pre-existing conduction abnormalities or left ventricular dysfunction are particularly susceptible to these effects. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity reactions.)

7. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: Lastly, the drug label mentions that in patients with acute myocardial infarction, the dosage of intravenous and subsequent oral atenolol was either discontinued or reduced for reasons such as hypotension/bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, heart block, arrhythmias, and other cardiac events.

114,BICALUTAMIDE,"1. **Warnings and Precautions (5.2):** There have been reports of excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) when bicalutamide is used concomitantly with coumarin anticoagulants, leading to serious bleeding. This suggests that bicalutamide can interact with coumarin anticoagulants to increase the risk of hemorrhage.

2. **Adverse Reactions (6.1):** In clinical trials, adverse reactions such as hypertension and cardiovascular events were reported in patients receiving bicalutamide plus an LHRH analog. This indicates that there is a potential association between bicalutamide use and cardiovascular adverse events.

3. **Postmarketing Experience (6.2):** Post-approval use of bicalutamide has identified cases of interstitial lung disease, including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, particularly at doses greater than 50 mg. This suggests a potential risk of cardiopulmonary toxicity associated with bicalutamide use.

In summary, bicalutamide has been associated with cardiotoxicity risks such as hemorrhage with coumarin anticoagulants, hypertension, and cardiovascular events in clinical trials, as well as cases of interstitial lung disease in postmarketing reports.

It states that beta-blocking agents should generally be avoided in patients with overt congestive heart failure. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

3. The label advises that in patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can precipitate cardiac failure. It suggests considering discontinuation of bisoprolol fumarate at the first signs or symptoms of heart failure. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

4. The label warns against the abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers, as it may lead to exacerbation of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia in patients with coronary artery disease. It recommends cautioning patients against interrupting or discontinuing therapy without a physician's advice. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

6. The label mentions that patients with bronchospastic disease should generally not receive beta-blockers. However, it notes that bisoprolol fumarate, due to its relative beta1-selectivity, may be cautiously used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatments. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

7. The label advises that chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn before major surgery, as the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may increase the risk of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

2. EPIDIOLEX has been linked to cases of cholestatic or mixed patterns of liver injury, as reported in patients treated with the drug. These patterns of liver injury were observed in patients taking EPIDIOLEX, suggesting a potential association between the drug and these hepatic reactions.

3. EPIDIOLEX can cause hypersensitivity reactions, with some subjects in clinical trials experiencing pruritus, erythema, and angioedema requiring treatment. Patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of EPIDIOLEX were excluded from the trials. This indicates that EPIDIOLEX itself may lead to hypersensitivity reactions.

4. EPIDIOLEX is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cannabidiol or any of the ingredients in the product, including sesame seed oil. This contraindication highlights the potential for EPIDIOLEX to trigger hypersensitivity reactions in susceptible individuals.",Less,No,Less,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

156,CARBOPROST TROMETHAMINE,"1. The drug label mentions that carboprost tromethamine, the active ingredient in Hemabate, can raise blood pressure in laboratory animals and humans, likely by contracting vascular smooth muscle. However, with the clinical doses used for terminating pregnancy, this effect has not been clinically significant. (The drug itself is associated with a potential risk of raising blood pressure but is not considered clinically significant at the doses used for pregnancy termination.)

2. The label also notes that large doses of carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature in laboratory animals and humans. Some patients may experience transient temperature increases with the clinical doses used for pregnancy termination. (The drug itself is associated with a potential risk of elevating body temperature, which may be transient in some patients.)

3. Additionally, the drug label mentions that in some patients, carboprost tromethamine may cause transient bronchoconstriction. (The drug itself is associated with a potential risk of causing transient bronchoconstriction in some patients.)

4. The label states that during clinical trials with Hemabate, chorioamnionitis was identified as a complication contributing to postpartum uterine atony and hemorrhage in some cases. This complication may have an inhibitory effect on the uterine response to Hemabate, similar to what has been reported for other oxytocic agents. (The drug itself is not directly associated with chorioamnionitis but may be affected by this condition, potentially impacting its efficacy in managing postpartum hemorrhage.)

5. In the postpartum hemorrhage series, a small percentage of patients experienced an increase in blood pressure as a side effect, which was moderate and may have been due to a direct effect of Hemabate or a return to pregnancy-associated hypertension. These cases did not require specific therapy for the elevated blood pressure. (The drug itself is associated with a potential risk of increasing blood pressure in a small percentage of patients, which may not require specific treatment.)

6. The label also mentions that Hemabate may augment the activity of other oxytocic agents and that concomitant use with other oxytocic agents is not recommended. (The drug itself is associated with a potential risk of enhancing the activity of other oxytocic agents when used concomitantly.)

Overall, Hemabate (carboprost tromethamine) has been associated with potential cardiotoxicity risks such as raising blood pressure, elevating body temperature, causing bronchoconstriction, and interacting with other oxytocic agents.

2. COREG should be taken with food to slow the rate of absorption and reduce the incidence of orthostatic effects. (No direct mention of cardiotoxicity risk associated with the drug itself)

3. In clinical trials, COREG caused bradycardia in about 2% of hypertensive subjects, 9% of subjects with heart failure, and 6.5% of subjects with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction. If pulse rate drops below 55 beats per minute, the dosage should be reduced. (COREG is associated with the risk of bradycardia, a cardiotoxicity reaction)

4. In clinical trials of primarily mild-to-moderate heart failure, hypotension and postural hypotension occurred in subjects receiving COREG. Starting with a low dose, administration with food, and gradual up-titration should decrease the likelihood of syncope or excessive hypotension. (COREG is associated with the risk of hypotension, a cardiotoxicity reaction)

5. Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased, and the carvedilol dose should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes. (COREG is associated with the risk of worsening heart failure or fluid retention, a cardiotoxicity reaction)

6. Patients with bronchospastic disease should generally not receive β-blockers like COREG. However, if deemed necessary, use with caution and at the lowest effective dose. (No direct mention of cardiotoxicity risk associated with the drug itself)

7. Beta-blockers like COREG may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia, and may lead to worsening hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. Blood glucose should be monitored when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing carvedilol dosing. (No direct mention of cardiotoxicity risk associated with the drug itself)

8. β-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals. (No direct mention of cardiotoxicity risk associated with the drug itself)

9. Rarely, use of carvedilol in patients with heart failure has resulted in deterioration of renal function. Renal function should be monitored during up-titration of carvedilol, and the drug discontinued or dosage reduced if worsening of renal function occurs. (No direct mention of cardiotoxicity risk associated with the drug itself)

10. Chronically administered β-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, as the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

The 28-Day all-cause mortality was higher in patients treated with FETROJA than in those treated with best available therapy, particularly in patients with nosocomial pneumonia, bloodstream infections, sepsis, or complicated urinary tract infections. The cause of the increase in mortality has not been established, but most deaths were in patients with infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, including non-fermenters like Acinetobacter baumannii complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

2. **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, including FETROJA. Hypersensitivity reactions were observed in FETROJA-treated patients in clinical trials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins.

3. **Seizures and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions:** Cephalosporins, including FETROJA, have been implicated in triggering seizures. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported with cephalosporins, particularly in patients with a history of epilepsy and/or when recommended dosages of cephalosporins were exceeded due to renal impairment. Adjusting FETROJA dosing based on creatinine clearance is recommended. Anticonvulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders. If CNS adverse reactions, including seizures, occur, patients should undergo a neurological evaluation to determine whether FETROJA should be discontinued.

198,CHLOROTHIAZIDE,"1. The drug label mentions that hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present or after prolonged therapy. This electrolyte imbalance can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and may sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. The drug itself is associated with the risk of hypokalemia-induced cardiotoxicity.

2. The label also states that thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism, which could potentially lead to cardiotoxic effects. The drug itself is associated with the risk of hypercalcemia-induced cardiotoxicity.

3. Additionally, the drug label mentions that thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion, which could impact calcium levels and potentially contribute to cardiotoxicity. The drug itself is associated with the risk of altered calcium metabolism and potential cardiotoxic effects.

4. The label warns that interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake can contribute to hypokalemia, which may cause cardiac arrhythmias and sensitize the heart to digitalis toxicity. The drug itself is associated with the risk of hypokalemia-induced cardiotoxicity.

5. Furthermore, the drug label cautions that hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias if digitalis has also been administered. This highlights the potential for synergistic cardiotoxic effects when the drug is used in combination with digitalis.

199,CHLORPROMAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug label warns of increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs, including chlorpromazine hydrochloride. The risk of death in drug-treated patients was found to be between 1.6 to 1.7 times higher compared to placebo-treated patients, with most deaths attributed to cardiovascular causes or infections.

2. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride may cause hypotensive effects, including postural hypotension, simple tachycardia, fainting, and dizziness, particularly after the first oral dose. Recovery is usually spontaneous, but severe and prolonged effects may lead to a shock-like condition.

3. EKG changes, such as nonspecific Q and T wave distortions, have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazine tranquilizers, including chlorpromazine. Sudden death, apparently due to cardiac arrest, has also been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs.

4. Cardiovascular adverse reactions, including hypotensive effects, EKG changes, and sudden death, have been noted in patients taking chlorpromazine. These reactions may occur more intensely in patients with specific medical conditions, such as mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma.

5. Autonomic reactions, such as dry mouth, nasal congestion, nausea, constipation, urinary retention, and priapism, have been reported with chlorpromazine use. These reactions may impact cardiovascular function and warrant monitoring for cardiotoxicity risks.",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

200,CHLORTHALIDONE,"1. The drug THALITONE (chlorthalidone) is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events such as strokes and myocardial infarctions. The benefits of cardiovascular risk reduction have been observed in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs, including THALITONE, but there are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction specifically with THALITONE itself.

2. THALITONE may cause symptomatic hypotension, particularly in patients with impaired sympathetic response, volume depletion, or salt restriction. However, a transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, and therapy can usually be continued once blood pressure stabilizes.

3. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by diuretics like THALITONE. Patients with pre-existing kidney disease, heart failure, or volume depletion may be at higher risk of developing acute renal failure while on THALITONE. Monitoring renal function periodically is recommended, and therapy may need to be withheld or discontinued in patients with a significant decrease in renal function.

4. THALITONE can cause electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can lead to difficult-to-treat hypokalemia despite potassium repletion. Monitoring serum electrolytes periodically is advised to manage and prevent these electrolyte imbalances effectively.

5. Chlorthalidone, the active ingredient in THALITONE, may raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, alter glucose tolerance, and increase serum uric acid levels. These metabolic disturbances can lead to hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Additionally, chlorthalidone decreases urinary calcium excretion, potentially causing elevations in serum calcium levels. Monitoring these metabolic parameters is essential during THALITONE therapy to address any abnormalities promptly.",Less,No,Less,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

227,CLONIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug label states that Duraclon (epidural clonidine) is not recommended for obstetrical, post-partum, or peri-operative pain management due to the risk of hemodynamic instability, especially hypotension and bradycardia, which may be unacceptable in these patients. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

2. Severe hypotension may follow the administration of clonidine, and it should be used with caution in all patients, especially those with severe cardiovascular disease or who are hemodynamically unstable. The benefit of its administration in these patients should be carefully balanced against the potential risks resulting from hypotension. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

3. The drug label mentions that clonidine decreases sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system, resulting in decreases in peripheral resistance, renal vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure. However, in the absence of profound hypotension, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate remain essentially unchanged. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

4. The label also warns about the potential for rebound hypertension, cerebrovascular accidents, and death after abrupt discontinuation of clonidine treatment, particularly in patients with a history of hypertension and/or other underlying cardiovascular conditions. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

5. Additionally, the drug label mentions that clonidine frequently causes decreases in heart rate, and symptomatic bradycardia can be treated with atropine. Rarely, atrioventricular block greater than first degree has been reported. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

6. The label also states that clonidine does not alter the hemodynamic response to exercise but may mask the increase in heart rate associated with hypovolemia. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

7. Furthermore, the drug label mentions that clonidine administration may result in sedation through the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the brainstem. High doses of clonidine can cause sedation and ventilatory abnormalities that are usually mild. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

8. The label also notes that depression has been seen in a small percentage of patients treated with oral or transdermal clonidine, and it may be exacerbated by treatment with clonidine. The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.

9.

2. Plavix is also indicated to reduce the rate of MI and stroke in patients with recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk.)

3. Plavix is a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor that works by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation through irreversible binding to P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk.)

4. Plavix has been evaluated for safety in over 54,000 patients, with bleeding being the most commonly reported adverse reaction, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding. (The drug itself is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which can be a cardiotoxicity risk.)

5. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported following the use of Plavix, which is a serious condition requiring urgent treatment, including plasmapheresis. TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of TTP, which can be a cardiotoxicity reaction.)

6. Plavix increases the risk of bleeding, including major bleeding events, which can be life-threatening. The risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of other drugs that increase bleeding risk, such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and NSAIDs. (The drug itself is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which can be a cardiotoxicity risk.)

7. Discontinuation of Plavix increases the risk of cardiovascular events, and premature discontinuation should be avoided. If temporary discontinuation is necessary, Plavix should be restarted as soon as possible. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk but discontinuation can lead to cardiovascular events.)

8. Plavix is contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding, such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage, due to the increased risk of bleeding associated with the drug. (The drug itself is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which can be a cardiotoxicity risk.)

9. Plavix should be used with caution in patients with impaired CYP2C19 function, as this can lead to diminished antiplatelet activity of the drug. Tests are available to identify patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk but may have reduced efficacy in patients with impaired CYP2C19 function.)

277,DEFIBROTIDE SODIUM,"1. The drug DEFITELIO (defibrotide sodium) injection is associated with a potential risk of cardiotoxicity, as it may enhance the pharmacodynamic activity of antithrombotic/fibrinolytic drugs, which can increase the risk of bleeding in patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) following hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). The drug itself is not directly causing cardiotoxicity but may contribute to an increased risk of bleeding, which can have cardiotoxic effects if not managed appropriately.

2. DEFITELIO has been shown to transiently prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in animal studies at doses higher than the clinical dose, indicating a potential effect on coagulation that could lead to bleeding events. This suggests that the drug may indirectly impact cardiotoxicity through its effects on coagulation parameters.

3. The drug label advises monitoring patients for signs of bleeding, as DEFITELIO may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients with VOD after HSCT.

286,DESVENLAFAXINE,"1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Desvenlafaxine was associated with increases in blood pressure observed in clinical studies. Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before initiating treatment with desvenlafaxine. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported with desvenlafaxine. Sustained blood pressure increases could have adverse consequences. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving desvenlafaxine, either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.

2. **Increased Risk of Bleeding**: Desvenlafaxine may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of desvenlafaxine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. Carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing desvenlafaxine in patients taking warfarin.

3. **Hyponatremia**: Desvenlafaxine may cause hyponatremia as a result of treatment. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with desvenlafaxine. Discontinuation of desvenlafaxine should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

4. **Interstitial Lung Disease and Eosinophilic Pneumonia**: Venlafaxine, the parent drug of desvenlafaxine, has been rarely associated with interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia. The possibility of these adverse events should be considered in patients treated with desvenlafaxine who present with progressive dyspnea, cough, or chest discomfort. Such patients should undergo a prompt medical evaluation, and discontinuation of desvenlafaxine should be considered.",Less,No,Less,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

291,DEXMEDETOMIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: The drug PRECEDEX has been associated with clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest, particularly in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, such as rapid intravenous or bolus administration. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of bradycardia and sinus arrest.)

2. **Cardiotoxicity Reactions**: Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been linked to PRECEDEX infusion, with some cases resulting in fatalities. Medical intervention may be necessary in such cases, including decreasing or stopping the infusion, increasing intravenous fluid administration, and using pressor agents. (The drug itself can lead to hypotension and bradycardia reactions.)

3. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: PRECEDEX may induce transient hypertension, primarily during the loading dose, due to initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects. Treatment of transient hypertension is generally not required, but reducing the loading infusion rate may be considered. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of transient hypertension.)

4. **Cardiotoxicity Reactions**: PRECEDEX has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, and clinicians should be prepared to intervene. In cases of bradycardia, intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents like glycopyrrolate or atropine may be considered. (The drug itself can exacerbate bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli.)

5. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: Caution should be exercised when administering PRECEDEX to patients with advanced heart block and severe ventricular dysfunction, as hypotension and bradycardia may be more pronounced in such patients, especially those with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, or elderly patients. (The drug itself is associated with increased risk of hypotension and bradycardia in specific patient populations.)

6. **Cardiotoxicity Reactions**: In clinical trials, where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with PRECEDEX, no additive pharmacodynamic effects were observed. However, caution is advised when using such agents concomitantly with PRECEDEX. (The drug itself does not have additive effects when co-administered with other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents.)

7. **Cardiotoxicity Risk**: PRECEDEX may induce hyperthermia or pyrexia, which could be resistant to traditional cooling methods. If drug-related hyperthermia is suspected, discontinuation of PRECEDEX is recommended, with close monitoring until body temperature normalizes.

2. Treatment with Dexrazoxane for Injection does not completely eliminate the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity. Monitor cardiac function before and periodically during therapy to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In general, if test results indicate deterioration in cardiac function associated with doxorubicin, the benefit of continued therapy should be carefully evaluated against the risk of producing irreversible cardiac damage. The drug itself is associated with not completely eliminating the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity.

3. Secondary malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have been reported in studies of pediatric patients who have received Dexrazoxane for Injection in combination with chemotherapy.

304,DICYCLOMINE HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug BENTYL (dicyclomine hydrochloride) is associated with cardiotoxicity risks due to its anticholinergic effects, which can worsen cardiovascular conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia, such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure, and in cardiac surgery, potentially accelerating heart rate. Investigating tachycardia before administration is recommended, especially in patients with coronary heart disease, hypertension, and unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage.

2. BENTYL's peripheral effects, resulting from its inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors, can lead to cardiovascular symptoms like dry mouth, difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, dilated pupils, flushing, bradycardia followed by tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmias, and constipation. These effects are dose-related and reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.

3. Heat prostration, a potential side effect of BENTYL use, can occur in high environmental temperatures, leading to fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating. Caution is advised in patients with fever, and if symptoms occur, the drug should be stopped, and supportive measures should be taken.

4. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals, such as elderly patients and those with mental illness, when given anticholinergic drugs like BENTYL. These central nervous system symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug.

5. Overdosing on BENTYL can lead to a curare-like action, causing neuromuscular blockade, muscular weakness, and possible paralysis, particularly in patients with myasthenia gravis. The drug should be used cautiously in these patients to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase.

6. BENTYL should be avoided in patients with severe ulcerative colitis due to the risk of suppressing intestinal motility, potentially leading to paralytic ileus and worsening toxic megacolon. Caution is advised in patients with ulcerative colitis to prevent serious complications.

7. Patients with prostatic hypertrophy should use BENTYL cautiously as the drug may exacerbate urinary retention. Monitoring for this adverse effect is recommended during treatment.

8. Patients with hepatic and renal disease should use BENTYL with caution due to potential risks associated with impaired hepatic and renal function. Monitoring these patients for adverse reactions is essential during treatment.",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

305,DIDANOSINE,"1. Didanosine delayed-release capsules have been associated with lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, when used alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine, indicating a direct association of the drug with cardiotoxicity risk.

2. Patients treated with didanosine delayed-release capsules in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis, which can lead to fatal outcomes. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose-related, suggesting a potential causal relationship between the drug and cardiotoxicity reactions.

3. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be used with extreme caution in patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, especially in those with advanced HIV-1 infection or renal impairment, as they may be at greater risk for developing pancreatitis. This highlights the importance of monitoring patients closely for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis to prevent cardiotoxicity reactions associated with the drug.

4. The safety and efficacy of didanosine delayed-release capsules have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. Patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, may have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. This suggests a potential risk of cardiotoxicity reactions in patients with liver disease when using the drug.

5. Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death, have been reported in patients receiving didanosine. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after starting didanosine therapy, indicating a potential delayed cardiotoxicity reaction associated with the drug.

306,DIETHYLPROPION HYDROCHLORIDE ER,"1. The drug label mentions that the use of anorectic agents, including diethylpropion, was associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, a rare but often fatal disorder. The label states that the use of anorectic agents for longer than 3 months was associated with a 23-fold increase in the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension.

2. The label also warns that valvular heart disease has been reported with some anorectic agents like fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, and although valvulopathy has been rarely reported with diethylpropion monotherapy, the causal relationship remains uncertain. This suggests that while the drug itself may not be definitively linked to valvular heart disease, caution is advised due to the potential risk.

3. It further mentions that the potential risk of serious adverse effects such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension should be carefully assessed against the potential benefit of weight loss. Baseline cardiac evaluation is recommended to detect preexisting valvular heart diseases or pulmonary hypertension before starting diethylpropion treatment. This indicates that the drug itself may pose risks of cardiotoxicity, and careful evaluation is necessary.

4. The label advises that diethylpropion should be discontinued if symptoms like exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema occur, as these could indicate the possibility of pulmonary hypertension. This suggests that the drug itself may lead to cardiotoxicity reactions that require immediate discontinuation.

318,DISOPYRAMIDE PHOSPHATE,"1. The drug Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) is associated with cardiotoxicity risks, including the potential to cause or worsen congestive heart failure, produce severe hypotension, and result in significant widening of the QRS complex. These effects are attributed to the drug's negative inotropic properties. Norpace should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure or hypotension, and discontinuation of the drug is recommended if these adverse effects occur.

2. Norpace has been linked to the prolongation of the Q-T interval, which can lead to worsening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Patients who show Q-T prolongation greater than 25% may be at particular risk, and close monitoring is advised. Disopyramide phosphate, the active ingredient in Norpace, has been associated with torsade de pointes, a specific type of ventricular tachycardia.

3. The drug Norpace may also cause hypoglycemia in rare instances, particularly in patients with certain underlying conditions such as congestive heart failure, chronic malnutrition, or hepatic and renal diseases. Physicians are advised to monitor blood glucose levels carefully in these patients to prevent potential complications.

4. Norpace is contraindicated in patients with certain cardiac conditions, such as cardiogenic shock, preexisting second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker, and congenital Q-T prolongation, due to the risk of exacerbating these conditions. The drug itself can lead to the development of heart block, which may necessitate dosage adjustments or discontinuation of therapy.

5. In cases of Norpace overdose, symptoms such as cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and conduction disturbances can occur, potentially leading to asystole and death. Toxic plasma levels of disopyramide can result in excessive widening of the QRS complex and Q-T interval, further highlighting the drug's cardiotoxic effects.

321,DOBUTAMINE,"1. The drug label mentions that dobutamine hydrochloride may cause a marked increase in heart rate or blood pressure, especially systolic pressure, with approximately 10% of adult patients experiencing rate increases of 30 beats/minute or more and about 7.5% having a 50-mm Hg or greater increase in systolic pressure. Usually, reduction of dosage reverses these effects. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of increased heart rate and blood pressure.)

2. The label also warns that dobutamine may precipitate or exacerbate ventricular ectopic activity, although it rarely causes ventricular tachycardia. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of ventricular ectopic activity.)

3. Additionally, the label mentions that dobutamine may cause reactions suggestive of hypersensitivity, including skin rash, fever, eosinophilia, and bronchospasm, and that it contains sodium bisulfite, which may cause allergic-type reactions such as anaphylaxis and asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible individuals. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of hypersensitivity reactions.)

4. The label advises that patients with atrial fibrillation are at risk of developing rapid ventricular response due to dobutamine's facilitation of atrioventricular conduction, and it recommends using a digitalis preparation in such cases. Patients with pre-existing hypertension may face an increased risk of developing an exaggerated pressure response. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation and exaggerated pressure response in patients with hypertension.)

5. Furthermore, the label mentions that dobutamine has been associated with decreases in serum potassium concentrations, rarely leading to hypokalemic values. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of hypokalemia.)

6. In cases of overdose, dobutamine may cause toxicity due to excessive cardiac β-receptor stimulation, leading to symptoms such as hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and ventricular fibrillation.

323,DOFETILIDE,"1. TIKOSYN can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, primarily Torsade de Pointes (TdP) type ventricular tachycardia, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias.)

2. QT interval prolongation is directly related to dofetilide plasma concentration. Factors such as reduced creatinine clearance or certain dofetilide drug interactions will increase dofetilide plasma concentration. (The drug itself is associated with QT interval prolongation, which is related to its plasma concentration.)

3. The risk of TdP can be reduced by controlling the plasma concentration through adjustment of the initial dofetilide dose according to creatinine clearance and by monitoring the ECG for excessive increases in the QT interval. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of Torsade de Pointes, which can be reduced by controlling plasma concentration and monitoring ECG.)

4. Treatment with dofetilide must be started only in patients placed for a minimum of three days in a facility that can provide electrocardiographic monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. (The drug itself requires specific monitoring and management due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias.)

5. The majority of the episodes of TdP occurred within the first three days of TIKOSYN therapy. (The drug itself is associated with the occurrence of Torsade de Pointes, with most cases happening within the initial days of therapy.)

6. In the supraventricular arrhythmia population, the overall incidence of Torsade de Pointes was 0.8%. (The drug itself is associated with the occurrence of Torsade de Pointes in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias.)

7. The rate of TdP was reduced when patients were dosed according to their renal function. (The drug itself is associated with a reduced risk of Torsade de Pointes when dosed based on renal function.)

8. The presence of atrial fibrillation did not affect the outcome of TIKOSYN in terms of cardiotoxicity. (The drug itself is not affected by the presence of atrial fibrillation in terms of cardiotoxicity.)

9. Because of the small number of events, an excess mortality due to TIKOSYN cannot be ruled out with confidence in the pooled survival analysis of placebo-controlled trials in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. (The drug itself may be associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, although not conclusively ruled out.)

10. Dofetilide is metabolized to a small degree by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 system, and an inhibitor of this system could increase systemic dofetilide exposure. (The drug itself is associated with potential drug-drug interactions that may increase systemic exposure.)

11. More importantly, dofetilide is eliminated by cationic renal secretion, and three inhibitors of this process have been shown to increase systemic dofetilide exposure. (The drug itself is associated with potential drug-drug interactions that may increase systemic exposure due to inhibition of renal elimination.)

12. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may occur with administration. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.)",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

359,ENTACAPONE,"1. The drug label mentions that when a single 400 mg dose of entacapone was given with intravenous isoprenaline (isoproterenol) and epinephrine without coadministered levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, the overall mean maximal changes in heart rate during infusion were about 50% and 80% higher than with placebo for isoprenaline and epinephrine, respectively. This indicates that entacapone itself was associated with increased heart rates and possible arrhythmias when administered with drugs metabolized by COMT.

2. The label also reports a case of ventricular tachycardia in a healthy volunteer after epinephrine infusion and oral entacapone administration, requiring treatment with propranolol. This suggests a probable causal relationship between entacapone administration and ventricular tachycardia, although certainty cannot be attributed. Therefore, entacapone was associated with ventricular tachycardia in this case.

3. Additionally, the label warns that drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and others, should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone, as their interaction may result in increased heart rates, possible arrhythmias, and excessive changes in blood pressure.

366,EPLERENONE,"1. The drug label mentions that INSPRA (eplerenone) is indicated for improving survival in stable patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). This indicates that the drug is used in patients with a history of heart failure and MI, suggesting a potential cardiotoxicity risk due to the underlying heart condition.

2. The label also states that adverse reactions reported in clinical trials of INSPRA for heart failure post-MI included hyperkalemia and increased creatinine. These adverse reactions were more frequent in patients treated with INSPRA compared to placebo, indicating a potential cardiotoxicity risk associated with the drug itself.

3. Additionally, the label mentions that patients with heart failure treated with INSPRA had an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo, with common reasons for discontinuation being hyperkalemia, MI, and abnormal renal function.

367,EPOPROSTENOL,"1. The drug label states that a large study evaluating the effect of epoprostenol on survival in patients with congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction was terminated due to a higher mortality rate in patients receiving epoprostenol plus conventional therapy compared to those receiving conventional therapy alone. The chronic use of VELETRI in patients with congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction is contraindicated. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

2. The label also mentions that some patients with pulmonary hypertension have developed pulmonary edema during dose initiation, which may be associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. VELETRI should not be used chronically in patients who develop pulmonary edema during dose initiation. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

3. Additionally, the label warns about the potential for high output cardiac failure as a cardiotoxicity reaction to epoprostenol. It advises considering dose reduction in such cases. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity reaction.)

4. The label further mentions that during clinical trials, adverse events related to the underlying disease of pulmonary arterial hypertension, such as right ventricular failure, have been reported. While some adverse events can be attributed to the disease, others, such as hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, and pulmonary edema, can be clearly attributed to epoprostenol. (The drug itself was associated with some of the cardiotoxicity reactions.)

5. Postmarketing experience with epoprostenol has identified high output cardiac failure as a potential cardiotoxicity reaction. The label advises considering dose reduction in such cases. (The drug itself was associated with the cardiotoxicity reaction.)

6. The label also mentions that there have been reports of hepatic failure in patients taking epoprostenol, although the relationship to epoprostenol administration has not been established. (The drug itself was not definitively associated with the cardiotoxicity risk, but the reaction was reported in patients taking the drug.)

Overall, the drug label indicates that VELETRI (epoprostenol) is associated with cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions, including high output cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, and potential hepatic failure. It is important to closely monitor patients for these potential adverse effects when using this medication.",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

416,FEDRATINIB HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug label warns about major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and mentions that another Janus Kinase (JAK)-inhibitor has increased the risk of MACE in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which INREBIC is not indicated. It advises considering the benefits and risks before initiating or continuing therapy with INREBIC, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and those with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. (The drug itself is not directly associated with causing cardiotoxicity but is mentioned in the context of another JAK-inhibitor increasing the risk of MACE.)

2. The label also mentions that thrombosis risks have been increased by another JAK-inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in patients with myelofibrosis treated with INREBIC in clinical trials, the rates of thromboembolic events were similar in INREBIC and placebo-treated patients. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. (The drug itself is not directly associated with causing thrombosis but is mentioned in the context of another JAK-inhibitor increasing the risk.)

3. Additionally, the label discusses the increased risk of secondary malignancies, including lymphoma and other malignancies, by another JAK-inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It advises considering the benefits and risks before initiating or continuing therapy with INREBIC, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated nonmelanoma skin cancer), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers. (The drug itself is not directly associated with causing secondary malignancies but is mentioned in the context of another JAK-inhibitor increasing the risk.)

In summary, while INREBIC itself is not directly associated with causing cardiotoxicity risks, the drug label mentions the increased risks of major adverse cardiac events, thrombosis, and secondary malignancies associated with another JAK-inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

418,FELODIPINE,"1. The drug label states that felodipine, a calcium channel blocker, may occasionally precipitate significant hypotension and, rarely, syncope, which may lead to reflex tachycardia and angina pectoris. This suggests that felodipine itself is associated with the risk of cardiotoxicity.
   
2. The label also mentions that during chronic administration of felodipine, a reflex increase in heart rate frequently occurs, which may attenuate over time. This indicates that felodipine itself may cause an increase in heart rate, which is a cardiotoxic reaction.

3. Clinical trials mentioned in the label did not note any symptoms suggestive of a negative inotropic effect in hypertensive patients without clinical evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. This suggests that felodipine is not associated with negative inotropic effects in this population.

4. The label further states that felodipine decreases renal vascular resistance while maintaining the glomerular filtration rate unchanged. Mild diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis have been observed during the first week of therapy. This indicates that felodipine may cause mild renal and electrolyte effects, which are important to monitor for potential cardiotoxicity risks.

5. Additionally, the label reports that increases in plasma noradrenaline levels have been observed in patients with hypertension during clinical trials. This suggests that felodipine may lead to alterations in plasma noradrenaline levels, which could have cardiotoxic implications.

6. The label also mentions that felodipine extended-release tablets have been associated with adverse events such as palpitations, hypotension, syncope, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and premature beats. These reactions indicate that felodipine itself may lead to various cardiotoxic effects.

7. Furthermore, the label lists myocardial infarction, chest pain, and other cardiovascular adverse events that occurred in patients receiving felodipine in controlled clinical trials. These events suggest that felodipine may be associated with an increased risk of cardiotoxicity.

8. Lastly, the label highlights that felodipine may cause peripheral edema, which was the most common adverse event observed in clinical trials. The incidence of peripheral edema was dose and age-dependent, indicating that felodipine itself may contribute to this cardiotoxic reaction.",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

419,FENFLURAMINE,"1. The drug label warns about an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity, including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA), and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with the risk of cardiotoxicity.

2. Echocardiogram assessments are required before, during, and after treatment with FINTEPLA to monitor for valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. This suggests that the drug itself may lead to cardiotoxicity and requires monitoring.

3. The drug label emphasizes that cardiac monitoring is necessary to evaluate for valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension before starting treatment with FINTEPLA. This indicates that the drug itself may pose a risk of cardiotoxicity that needs to be assessed prior to treatment initiation.

4. The label states that no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension during clinical trials of up to 3 years in duration. This suggests that while the drug is associated with cardiotoxicity risks, no cases were reported in the trials.

5. The drug label mentions that patients must undergo echocardiogram assessments every 6 months during treatment with FINTEPLA and 3 to 6 months after the final dose to evaluate for valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. This indicates that the drug itself may lead to cardiotoxicity that requires ongoing monitoring.

6. The label highlights that FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the FINTEPLA REMS due to the risks of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

420,FENOFIBRATE,"1. **Indications and Usage:** The drug, Antara, was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This indicates that the drug itself was not associated with reducing these risks.

2. **Warnings and Precautions - Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity:** The drug, Antara, did not show a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The clinical significance of the findings in the ACCORD Lipid trial and the FIELD study regarding cardiovascular outcomes is unclear. This suggests that the drug itself did not demonstrate a clear benefit in reducing cardiovascular risks in these specific patient populations.

3. **Warnings and Precautions - Hepatotoxicity:** Serious drug-induced liver injury, including liver transplantation and death, has been reported with Antara. This indicates a risk of liver-related adverse events associated with the drug.

4. **Warnings and Precautions - Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis:** Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking fenofibrate, with an increased risk observed when fenofibrate is co-administered with a statin. This suggests a potential risk of muscle-related adverse events associated with the drug, particularly when used in combination with certain medications.

5. **Warnings and Precautions - Venothromboembolic Disease:** In the FIELD trial, pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis were observed at higher rates in the fenofibrate-treated group compared to the placebo group. This indicates a potential risk of venothromboembolic events associated with the use of Antara.

6. **Warnings and Precautions - Paradoxical Decreases in HDL Cholesterol Levels:** Severe decreases in HDL cholesterol levels have been reported in patients initiated on fibrate therapy, including Antara. The decrease in HDL-C levels was observed after initiation of fibrate therapy and returned to baseline upon withdrawal of the drug. This suggests a potential impact of the drug on HDL cholesterol levels, which is an important factor in cardiovascular health.

7. **Adverse Reactions - Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity:** The adverse findings in large randomized clinical studies with other fibrate drugs may also apply to Antara, indicating a potential association with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

8. **Adverse Reactions - Hepatotoxicity:** Increases in liver function tests were observed in patients taking fenofibrate, leading to discontinuation of treatment in some cases. This suggests a potential risk of liver-related adverse events associated with the drug.

The drug itself is not directly associated with causing cardiotoxicity but is used to assess cardiac function and metabolism, which may indirectly reveal cardiotoxicity issues.

3. The drug label explains that Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection PET imaging in cardiology can predict reversible or irreversible loss of systolic function in myocardial segments based on glucose metabolism patterns. It mentions that false-positive and false-negative results can occur, indicating that the drug's imaging results may not always accurately reflect cardiotoxicity risks.

4. The label also states that the decision for a patient to undergo revascularization should not be based solely on PET findings, as false-positive and false-negative tests are common.

472,FOSTEMSAVIR TROMETHAMINE,"1. **QTc Prolongation Risk**: RUKOBIA has been shown to significantly prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram at higher than recommended dosages, specifically at 2,400 mg twice daily, which is four times the recommended daily dose. This indicates that RUKOBIA itself is associated with the risk of QTc prolongation.

2. **QTc Prolongation Caution**: It is advised to use RUKOBIA with caution in patients with a history of QTc interval prolongation, when coadministered with a drug known to have a risk of Torsade de Pointes, or in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. This suggests that RUKOBIA may exacerbate existing QTc prolongation or cardiac conditions.

3. **Immune Reconstitution Syndrome**: While not directly related to cardiotoxicity, immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including RUKOBIA. This syndrome may involve inflammatory responses that could potentially impact cardiac health in affected individuals.

4. **Elevations in Hepatic Transaminases**: Elevations in hepatic transaminases were observed in a greater proportion of subjects with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection compared to those with HIV mono-infection. While this is primarily related to liver function, hepatic issues can have secondary effects on cardiac health.

5. **Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions**: Certain drug interactions with RUKOBIA may lead to a loss of therapeutic effect or possible prolongation of the QTc interval. This indicates that interactions involving RUKOBIA could potentially impact cardiac safety.

6. **Drugs that Prolong QT Interval**: Coadministration of RUKOBIA with a drug known to have a risk of Torsade de Pointes may increase the risk of this condition. This highlights the potential for RUKOBIA to interact with other drugs that can affect cardiac electrophysiology.

Overall, RUKOBIA carries a risk of QTc prolongation, especially at higher dosages, and may interact with other medications to potentially impact cardiac function.

498,GLIMEPIRIDE,"1. Glimepiride tablets are associated with a potential increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, as reported in a study comparing oral hypoglycemic drugs to diet alone or diet plus insulin. The study showed a higher rate of cardiovascular mortality in patients treated with tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea similar to glimepiride, compared to those on diet alone.

2. The drug label warns that there is no conclusive evidence from clinical studies establishing a reduction in macrovascular risk with glimepiride or any other antidiabetic drug. This suggests that the drug itself has not been proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events on a larger scale.

3. The label also mentions that certain medications may affect glucose metabolism, potentially leading to dose adjustments and close monitoring of blood glucose levels when used concomitantly with glimepiride. This indicates that the risk of cardiotoxicity may be influenced by interactions with other medications affecting glucose metabolism.

4. Additionally, the drug label highlights the potential interaction between glimepiride and miconazole, which can lead to severe hypoglycemia. This interaction suggests a risk of cardiotoxicity associated with the concomitant use of these two medications.

572,ISRADIPINE,"1. Isradipine is a calcium antagonist that binds to calcium channels and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and smooth muscle, which can lead to dilating effects in arterioles, reducing systemic resistance and lowering blood pressure. The drug has negative inotropic effects
in vitro, but studies in animals and humans suggest that the vasodilating effect occurs at lower doses than those affecting contractility. Isradipine's afterload reducing properties may lead to some increase in cardiac output in patients with normal ventricular function. (The drug itself is associated with cardiotoxicity risks due to its mechanism of action on calcium channels.)

2. Isradipine has been shown to reduce blood pressure within 2 to 3 hours following administration, with a duration of action of more than 12 hours at higher doses. Chronic administration of divided doses in the range of 5 to 20 mg daily has been effective in reducing blood pressure, with dose-related responses observed. Isradipine is equally effective in reducing supine, sitting, and standing blood pressure. (The drug itself is associated with cardiotoxicity risks due to its blood pressure-lowering effects.)

3. Hemodynamic studies in patients with normal left ventricular function have shown that isradipine can increase cardiac index, stroke volume index, coronary sinus blood flow, heart rate, and peak positive left ventricular dP/dt, while decreasing systemic, coronary, and pulmonary vascular resistance. The clinical consequences of these hemodynamic effects have not been fully evaluated. (The drug itself is associated with cardiotoxicity risks due to its effects on hemodynamics.)

4. Isradipine has been shown to have variable effects on heart rate, depending on the rate of administration and underlying cardiac conditions. While some positive effects on cardiac performance have been observed in certain studies, the overall clinical consequences of these effects remain unclear. (The drug itself is associated with cardiotoxicity risks due to its effects on heart rate and cardiac function.)

5. In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were seen with the use of isradipine in electrophysiologic studies. However, slight prolongation of the QTc interval was observed in one study, and effects on sinus node recovery time were mild or not seen. Isradipine did not have a depressant effect on sinus and atrioventricular node function in patients with sick sinus syndrome. (The drug itself is not associated with significant cardiotoxicity risks based on electrophysiologic studies.)

6. Isradipine has been associated with adverse reactions such as palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in rare cases. These cardiovascular events are considered possibly drug-related, and their relationship to isradipine administration is uncertain. (The drug itself is associated with rare cardiotoxicity reactions based on reported adverse events.)

7. Overdosage with isradipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation, marked systemic hypotension, and tachycardia. Severe hypotension and AV conduction disturbances may require active cardiovascular support, including monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of lower extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume. (The drug itself is associated with cardiotoxicity risks in cases of overdosage, leading to severe hypotension and tachycardia.)",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

587,LABETALOL HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. **Warnings and Precautions - Cardiac Failure:** The drug, Labetalol HCl, is associated with the risk of exacerbating heart failure. It is advised to avoid using Labetalol HCl in patients with overt congestive heart failure. If signs or symptoms of heart failure develop during administration, discontinuation of the drug is recommended.

2. **Warnings and Precautions - Ischemic Heart Disease:** Abrupt cessation of therapy with beta blockers like Labetalol HCl in patients with coronary artery disease can lead to exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction. Therefore, even in the absence of overt angina pectoris, after discontinuation of Labetalol HCl, patients should be observed for the development or worsening of angina. Prompt reinstitution of Labetalol HCl is advised if angina occurs or worsens.

3. **Warnings and Precautions - Hypotension:** Symptomatic postural hypotension is likely to occur with Labetalol HCl, especially if patients are tilted or allowed to assume the upright position within 3 hours of receiving the drug. Before permitting ambulation, the patient's ability to tolerate an upright position should be established, and observation is necessary at the time of first ambulation.

4. **Warnings and Precautions - Bradycardia:** Labetalol HCl can cause bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. Monitoring heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving Labetalol HCl is essential to detect and manage any bradycardia that may occur.

5. **Warnings and Precautions - Hypoglycemia:** Labetalol HCl may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or those who are fasting. Severe hypoglycemia can occur at any time during treatment, necessitating prompt medical treatment. The drug itself is associated with the risk of hypoglycemia due to its beta-blocking effects.

6. **Warnings and Precautions - Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma:** Labetalol HCl has been shown to lower blood pressure and relieve symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma. However, paradoxical hypertensive responses have been reported in a few patients with this tumor. Therefore, blood pressure monitoring is crucial when administering Labetalol HCl to patients with pheochromocytoma.

7. **Warnings and Precautions - Hepatic Injury:** Severe hepatocellular injury, although rare, can occur with Labetalol therapy. Hepatic injury is usually reversible, but cases of hepatic necrosis and death have been reported. If signs or symptoms of liver injury develop, appropriate treatment should be initiated, and Labetalol should be permanently discontinued.

592,LANREOTIDE ACETATE,"1. Cardiotoxicity Risks:
- The drug SOMATULINE DEPOT may lead to a decrease in heart rate, with sinus bradycardia, bradycardia, and hypertension being the most common cardiac adverse reactions observed in patients with acromegaly. The decrease in heart rate may occur in patients without underlying cardiac disease, and caution is advised when initiating treatment in patients with bradycardia. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of cardiotoxicity by potentially causing a decrease in heart rate.)
- A comparative echocardiography study showed no difference in the development of new or worsening valvular regurgitation between lanreotide and another somatostatin analog over 1 year. Clinically significant mitral or aortic regurgitation was low in both groups throughout the study. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risks in terms of valvular regurgitation.)
- In patients with acromegaly treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT, sinus bradycardia was the most frequently observed heart rate and rhythm disorder, with other cardiac adverse reactions observed in less than 1% of patients. The relationship of these events to SOMATULINE DEPOT could not be established due to many patients having underlying cardiac disease.

- The most common overall cardiac adverse reactions observed in patients with acromegaly treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT were sinus bradycardia, bradycardia, and hypertension. In patients without underlying cardiac disease, the drug may lead to a decrease in heart rate without necessarily reaching the threshold of bradycardia. (The drug itself is associated with the occurrence of sinus bradycardia, bradycardia, and hypertension as adverse reactions.)
- In clinical studies, sinus bradycardia was the most frequently observed heart rate and rhythm disorder in patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT. Other cardiac adverse reactions were observed in less than 1% of patients, with the majority having underlying cardiac disease. (The drug itself is associated with the occurrence of sinus bradycardia and other cardiac adverse reactions in patients with acromegaly.)

3. The drug label advises performing an ECG before each dose increase and regularly monitoring ECG for an effect on the QT interval during RECORLEV treatment. Correcting hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to treatment initiation and periodic monitoring during treatment are also recommended. These precautions are necessary due to the potential cardiotoxic effects of RECORLEV.

4. If the QTcF interval exceeds 500 msec, temporary discontinuation of RECORLEV is recommended. After correction of contributing factors and normalization of the QTcF interval, the drug may be resumed at a lower dose.

677,METHOCARBAMOL,"1. The drug label mentions that methocarbamol, the active ingredient in ROBAXIN Injectable, is a central nervous system depressant with sedative properties, but it has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. This indicates that the drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk.

2. The label does not specifically mention any direct cardiotoxicity risks associated with methocarbamol. However, it does caution that patients receiving ROBAXIN Injectable should be warned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, which could potentially lead to cardiovascular depression. This suggests that the drug may have indirect cardiotoxic effects when combined with other substances.

3. The label lists hypotension as a potential cardiovascular system adverse reaction associated with methocarbamol administration. This indicates that the drug itself may lead to hypotension, a form of cardiotoxicity, as an adverse reaction.

4. The label also mentions syncope as an adverse reaction that has been reported with methocarbamol administration. Syncope, or fainting, can be related to cardiovascular issues, indicating a potential cardiotoxic effect of the drug.

5. Thrombophlebitis is another cardiovascular system adverse reaction listed in the drug label. Thrombophlebitis is the inflammation of a vein due to a blood clot, which can have implications for cardiovascular health, suggesting a cardiotoxic risk associated with methocarbamol use.

In summary, while the drug label does not explicitly state that methocarbamol is directly cardiotoxic, it does mention potential adverse reactions such as hypotension, syncope, and thrombophlebitis that suggest a risk of cardiotoxicity with the use of ROBAXIN Injectable.

692,METOPROLOL SUCCINATE,"1. **Warnings and Precautions**: Abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, including TOPROL-XL, may lead to exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. It is advised to gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient to prevent these adverse events.

2. **Warnings and Precautions**: Worsening cardiac failure may occur during the up-titration of TOPROL-XL. If symptoms of worsening heart failure occur, diuretics should be increased, and clinical stability should be restored before advancing the dose of TOPROL-XL. This indicates that TOPROL-XL itself may lead to worsening heart failure.

3. **Warnings and Precautions**: Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest, have occurred with the use of TOPROL-XL. Patients with certain pre-existing conditions or on concomitant drugs that cause bradycardia may be at increased risk. Monitoring heart rate is recommended, and if severe bradycardia develops, reducing or stopping TOPROL-XL is advised. This suggests that TOPROL-XL itself can lead to bradycardia.

4. **Warnings and Precautions**: If TOPROL-XL is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha-blocker. Administration of beta-blockers alone in this setting has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle. This indicates that TOPROL-XL can potentially lead to adverse effects in patients with pheochromocytoma.

5. **Warnings and Precautions**: Avoid initiation of a high-dose regimen of extended-release metoprolol in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, as it has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke, and death in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. This suggests that TOPROL-XL itself may pose risks in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

6. **Warnings and Precautions**: Beta-blockers, including TOPROL-XL, may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, potentially increasing the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or those who are fasting. This indicates that TOPROL-XL may mask early signs of hypoglycemia.

7. **Warnings and Precautions**: Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease.

695,MEXILETINE HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug Mexiletine hydrochloride is associated with cardiotoxicity risks, as mentioned in the Warnings section of the label. It states that the use of Mexiletine should be reserved for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias due to known proarrhythmic properties of Mexiletine and lack of evidence of improved survival in patients without life-threatening arrhythmias.

2. The label also warns about the potential risk of acute liver injury associated with Mexiletine use, as abnormal liver function tests have been reported post-marketing, particularly in patients with congestive heart failure or ischemia. The relationship between Mexiletine and liver injury has not been fully established.

3. Additionally, the label mentions the possibility of drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) in patients taking Mexiletine, which can present with various organ involvement, including the liver. Mexiletine should be discontinued if DRESS is suspected.

4. The label further discusses the potential for worsening of arrhythmias with Mexiletine use, particularly in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias like sustained ventricular tachycardia. Mexiletine has been associated with exacerbation of arrhythmias in a small percentage of patients, although the rate is not greater than that of other antiarrhythmic agents.

5. Mexiletine may also cause mild depression of myocardial function, similar to lidocaine, particularly following intravenous therapy in patients with cardiac disease. This effect is mentioned as a potential cardiotoxicity reaction associated with Mexiletine use.

6. The label highlights the importance of monitoring patients with hepatic impairment closely while receiving Mexiletine, as liver disease can prolong the elimination half-life of Mexiletine. Mexiletine is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic dysfunction can impact the clearance of Mexiletine and its metabolites, potentially leading to cardiotoxic effects.

7. Mexiletine has been associated with elevations in liver enzymes, although these elevations are often asymptomatic and transient, and do not always require discontinuation of therapy. However, marked elevations in liver enzymes have been observed in patients with severe cardiac disease, indicating a potential cardiotoxic effect of Mexiletine.

8. The label also mentions the possibility of blood dyscrasias, including leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, associated with Mexiletine use. While these events were rare in controlled trials, they occurred in a small percentage of patients in the compassionate use program, indicating a potential cardiotoxic reaction to Mexiletine.",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

722,MOXIFLOXACIN HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug Moxifloxacin has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients, with a mean change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with QT prolongation.

2. Moxifloxacin should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, uncorrected hypokalemia, and those receiving certain antiarrhythmic agents due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations. This suggests that the drug itself may exacerbate existing QT prolongation risks.

3. The drug should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia. This indicates that the drug itself may pose risks in patients with specific cardiac conditions.

4. Moxifloxacin has been associated with an increased risk of seizures, increased intracranial pressure, dizziness, and tremors, which are central nervous system effects that may impact cardiac function. This suggests that the drug itself may lead to adverse cardiac effects through its impact on the central nervous system.

5. The drug has been linked to an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months of use, particularly in elderly patients. This indicates that the drug itself may contribute to the risk of aortic complications.

6.

749,NIACIN,"1. The drug label mentions that NIASPAN, when coadministered with simvastatin, did not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events more than simvastatin alone in a randomized controlled trial. This suggests that NIASPAN did not provide incremental benefit in reducing cardiovascular events over simvastatin alone.

2. The AIM-HIGH trial, involving patients with stable cardiovascular disease, showed that the addition of NIASPAN to simvastatin did not demonstrate efficacy in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease events compared to simvastatin alone. This indicates that the combination of NIASPAN and simvastatin did not show a significant benefit in reducing cardiovascular events.

3. The drug label also mentions that cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with the concomitant administration of niacin and statins, particularly lovastatin or simvastatin. This suggests that the combination of NIASPAN with these statins may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis.

4. Severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, has occurred in patients who substituted sustained-release niacin products for immediate-release niacin at equivalent doses. This indicates that the substitution of niacin formulations can lead to severe hepatic toxicity.

5. The label warns that NIASPAN should be used with caution in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of a myocardial infarction, especially when vasoactive drugs are also being administered. This suggests that NIASPAN may pose risks in patients with certain cardiovascular conditions.

6. NIASPAN is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained elevations in hepatic transaminases. This indicates that NIASPAN may exacerbate liver conditions or cause liver enzyme abnormalities.

7. The drug label advises monitoring liver enzymes before and during treatment with NIASPAN due to the risk of persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels. This suggests that NIASPAN may lead to liver enzyme abnormalities.

8. NIASPAN has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count and increases in prothrombin time. This indicates that NIASPAN may affect blood clotting parameters, potentially leading to cardiotoxicity risks.

750,NICARDIPINE HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug CARDENE IV (nicardipine hydrochloride) is a calcium channel blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. It is not directly associated with causing cardiotoxicity risks.

2. In patients with coronary artery disease, CARDENE IV has been shown to improve left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, probably due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly by indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. The drug itself is not directly linked to causing cardiotoxicity risks.

3. CARDENE IV has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical benefits of these properties have not yet been demonstrated. The drug does not pose a direct cardiotoxicity risk based on this information.

4. During acute electrophysiologic studies, CARDENE IV increased heart rate and prolonged the corrected QT interval to a minor degree. It did not affect sinus node recovery or SA conduction times. The PA, AH, and HV intervals or the functional and effective refractory periods of the atrium were not prolonged. The relative and effective refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system were slightly shortened. While there are some effects on cardiac electrophysiology, the drug itself is not directly associated with causing significant cardiotoxicity risks.

Overall, based on the information provided in the drug label, CARDENE IV does not appear to be directly linked to causing significant cardiotoxicity risks or reactions. It primarily functions as a calcium channel blocker for the treatment of hypertension, with some effects on cardiac function and electrophysiology noted in the clinical studies.",Less,No,Less,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

751,NIFEDIPINE,"1. The drug PROCARDIA XL (nifedipine) is a calcium channel blocker that inhibits calcium ion influx into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle, without altering serum calcium concentrations. This mechanism of action is associated with a negative inotropic effect on isolated myocardial tissue, but this effect is rarely seen in intact animals or humans due to reflex responses to its vasodilating effects.

2. PROCARDIA XL is indicated for the management of vasospastic angina and chronic stable angina, as well as hypertension. The drug has been shown to reduce angina frequency and increase exercise tolerance in controlled trials, but long-term effectiveness and safety in these patients are still being evaluated.

3. There have been reports of increased frequency, duration, and severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction in some patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease upon starting nifedipine or during dosage increases. The mechanism of this effect is not established, suggesting a potential association with the drug.

4. Patients recently withdrawn from beta blockers may develop a withdrawal syndrome with increased angina upon initiation of nifedipine treatment. This occurrence is not prevented by nifedipine and may even exacerbate it, indicating a potential risk when transitioning between medications.

5. Rare cases of patients, usually receiving a beta blocker, developing heart failure after starting nifedipine have been reported. Patients with tight aortic stenosis may be at greater risk for this event, suggesting a potential association between nifedipine use and heart failure in certain patient populations.

6. There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms, including gastrointestinal obstruction requiring surgery, in patients with known strictures associated with the ingestion of PROCARDIA XL. This suggests a potential risk of gastrointestinal obstruction with the use of the drug.

7. Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. This indicates a potential risk of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with the use of PROCARDIA XL.

8. Nifedipine has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation
in vitro, which may result in a moderate decrease in platelet aggregation and an increase in bleeding time in some patients. This suggests a potential cardiotoxic effect on platelet function associated with nifedipine use.

9. Positive direct Coombs test with or without hemolytic anemia has been reported in patients taking nifedipine, although a causal relationship between nifedipine administration and this laboratory test could not be determined. This indicates a potential association between nifedipine use and hemolytic anemia, although the exact mechanism is unclear.",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

757,NISOLDIPINE,"1. The drug label mentions that patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease have rarely developed increased frequency, duration, and/or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction upon starting calcium channel blocker therapy or increasing the dosage. The label states that this effect was seen about 1.5% of the time in patients given nisoldipine compared to 0.9% in patients given placebo. This suggests that nisoldipine may be associated with an increased risk of angina or myocardial infarction in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

2. The label also warns about the potential for increased angina and/or myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease. Controlled studies of SULAR in patients with angina showed an incidence of about 1.5% in patients given nisoldipine compared to 0.9% in patients given placebo. This indicates that nisoldipine may be associated with an increased risk of angina and myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease.

3. The label advises caution when using SULAR in patients with heart failure or compromised ventricular function, particularly when used in combination with a beta-blocker. Although acute hemodynamic studies did not demonstrate negative inotropic effects, the safety of SULAR in patients with heart failure has not been established. This suggests that nisoldipine may pose a risk of worsening heart failure in patients with compromised ventricular function.

4. The label mentions that nisoldipine did not lead to worsening of clinical heart failure in studies of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. However, there is limited information on the use of nisoldipine in patients with severe congestive heart failure, and caution is advised when using all calcium channel blockers in any patient with heart failure.

764,NORETHINDRONE,"1. The drug label warns that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular disease and advises women using oral contraceptives, like Micronor, not to smoke. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity but smoking while using the drug increases the risk of cardiovascular issues.)

2. The drug label states that the relationship between progestin-only oral contraceptives, like Micronor, and serious health risks associated with estrogen components of combined oral contraceptives is not fully defined. It advises healthcare professionals to remain alert to the earliest manifestation of symptoms of any serious disease and discontinue oral contraceptive therapy when appropriate. (The drug itself is not directly linked to cardiotoxicity risks but the relationship with serious health risks is not fully understood.)

3. The drug label mentions that some epidemiological studies have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer in oral contraceptive users, particularly at a younger age and apparently related to duration of use. However, these studies predominantly involved combined oral contraceptives, and there is insufficient data to determine if the use of progestin-only oral contraceptives, like Micronor, similarly increases the risk. (The drug itself is not definitively associated with cardiotoxicity risks, but there are concerns about potential links to breast cancer.)

4. The drug label discusses the risk of benign hepatic adenomas associated with combined oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Rupture of benign hepatic adenomas may cause death through intraabdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in combined oral contraceptive users, but these cancers are rare in the U.S. There is insufficient data to determine whether progestin-only oral contraceptives, like Micronor, increase the risk of developing hepatic neoplasia. (The drug itself is not directly linked to cardiotoxicity risks, but there are concerns about liver tumors associated with combined oral contraceptives, and insufficient data for progestin-only contraceptives.)

814,PAROXETINE MESYLATE,"1. The drug label mentions that paroxetine, the active ingredient in PEXEVA, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations in infants when exposed during the first trimester of pregnancy. This suggests that paroxetine itself is linked to embryofetal cardiotoxicity risk.

2. Additionally, the label warns about the potential for QT prolongation when paroxetine is used in combination with thioridazine and pimozide, which can lead to serious ventricular arrhythmias. This indicates that paroxetine can interact with these drugs to cause cardiotoxicity reactions.

3. The label also highlights the increased risk of bleeding events with drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake, including PEXEVA. This suggests that PEXEVA itself may contribute to cardiotoxicity through an increased risk of bleeding.

4. Furthermore, the drug label mentions that paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide due to its CYP2D6 inhibitory properties, which can lead to QT prolongation and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias. This indicates that paroxetine can interact with these drugs to cause cardiotoxicity reactions.

5. The label advises monitoring patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome when taking PEXEVA, especially when co-administered with other serotonergic drugs, as serotonin syndrome can be life-threatening. This suggests that PEXEVA itself can contribute to cardiotoxicity through the risk of serotonin syndrome.

6. Lastly, the drug label mentions that paroxetine may cause hyponatremia, which can lead to symptoms like headache, confusion, and respiratory arrest. This indicates that paroxetine itself is associated with the risk of hyponatremia-related cardiotoxicity.",Most,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

828,PENTOBARBITAL SODIUM,"1. The drug label mentions that barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, are capable of producing all levels of central nervous system mood alteration and can cause death in cases of overdosage. High therapeutic doses of barbiturates can induce anesthesia, depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce drowsiness, sedation, and hypnosis. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

2. Barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, are known to be respiratory depressants, and the degree of respiratory depression is dose-dependent. With hypnotic doses, respiratory depression produced by barbiturates is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep, with a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

3. The drug label mentions that barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, have been found to cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder in laboratory animals. However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

4. Barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, do not impair normal hepatic function but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

5. The drug label states that barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids, with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

6. Barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree, with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

7. The drug label mentions that phenobarbital, a type of barbiturate, has been associated with carcinogenic effects in mice and rats after lifetime administration. In mice, it produced benign and malignant liver cell tumors, and in rats, benign liver cell tumors were observed very late in life. (Phenobarbital, a component of Nembutal Sodium Solution, is associated with carcinogenic effects but not directly with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

8. The drug label also states that barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, may be habit-forming, and tolerance, psychological dependence, and physical dependence may occur with continued use. Patients who have psychological dependence on barbiturates may increase the dosage or decrease the dosage interval without consulting a physician and may subsequently develop physical dependence on barbiturates. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

9. The drug label warns that too rapid administration of Nembutal Sodium Solution may cause respiratory depression, apnea, laryngospasm, or vasodilation with a fall in blood pressure. (Nembutal Sodium Solution itself is associated with the risk of respiratory depression and a fall in blood pressure, which can be considered cardiotoxicity risks.)

10. The drug label cautions that barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, should be administered with caution to patients with acute or chronic pain, as paradoxical excitement could be induced or important symptoms could be masked. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk in this sentence.)

11. The drug label mentions that full anesthetic doses of barbiturates, including Nembutal Sodium Solution, decrease the force and frequency of uterine contractions during labor. Administration of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates to the mother during labor may result in respiratory depression in the newborn. (Nembutal Sodium Solution itself is associated with the risk of respiratory depression in newborns, which can be considered a cardiotoxicity reaction.)

12. The drug label also states that premature infants are particularly susceptible to the depressant effects of barbiturates, and if Nembutal Sodium Solution is used during labor and delivery, resuscitation equipment should be available. (Nembutal Sodium Solution itself is associated with the risk of depressant effects in premature infants, which can be considered a cardiotoxicity risk.)",Less,No,Less,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

The drug label mentions that ELMIRON is a weak anticoagulant and may cause rectal hemorrhage as an adverse event, with a reported incidence of 6.3% in patients receiving a daily dose of 300 mg. This suggests that ELMIRON itself is associated with the risk of rectal hemorrhage, a form of bleeding, which can be considered a cardiotoxicity risk.

2. Additionally, the label states that bleeding complications such as ecchymosis, epistaxis, and gum hemorrhage have been reported with ELMIRON use. This indicates that ELMIRON itself is associated with the risk of various bleeding complications, which can be considered cardiotoxicity risks.

3. The label also mentions that patients undergoing invasive procedures or having signs/symptoms of underlying coagulopathy or other increased risk of bleeding should be evaluated for hemorrhage before starting ELMIRON. This suggests that ELMIRON itself can exacerbate bleeding risks in patients with underlying coagulopathy or other conditions, indicating a cardiotoxicity risk.

4. Furthermore, the label highlights that a similar product associated with delayed immunoallergic thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage should be used with caution in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This suggests that ELMIRON, being a weak anticoagulant, may pose a cardiotoxicity risk in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia due to its potential to exacerbate thrombotic and bleeding complications.

5. The label also mentions that alopecia, a side effect associated with ELMIRON, began within the first 4 weeks of treatment, with 97% of cases being alopecia areata limited to a single area on the scalp.

839,PHENOXYBENZAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug Dibenzyline (phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride) is an adrenergic, alpha-receptor-blocking agent that can produce and maintain ""chemical sympathectomy"" by oral administration, increasing blood flow to certain areas and lowering blood pressure. It has no effect on the parasympathetic system. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk.)

2. Dibenzyline-induced alpha-adrenergic blockade leaves beta-adrenergic receptors unopposed, potentially leading to an exaggerated hypotensive response and tachycardia when compounds that stimulate both types of receptors are used concomitantly. (The drug itself is associated with a cardiotoxicity risk due to its mechanism of action.)

3. In cases of overdose, symptoms may include postural hypotension, tachycardia, vomiting, lethargy, and shock, largely due to blocking of the sympathetic nervous system and circulating epinephrine. Treatment of circulatory failure is a prime consideration, and usual pressor agents are not effective. (The drug itself is associated with cardiotoxicity reactions in cases of overdose.)

4. Epinephrine is contraindicated in cases of overdose because it stimulates both alpha- and beta-receptors, leading to vasodilation and a further drop in blood pressure.

851,PIROXICAM,"1. The drug label warns that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including FELDENE, are associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

2. FELDENE is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

3. Clinical trials have shown that several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs, including FELDENE, have an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. The risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events may be similar for all NSAIDs, and the risk increases with higher doses. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

4. Patients treated with NSAIDs, including FELDENE, in the post-myocardial infarction (MI) period were at an increased risk of reinfarction, cardiovascular-related death, and all-cause mortality. The risk of death in NSAID users persisted over several years of follow-up. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

5. FELDENE should be avoided in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits outweigh the risk of recurrent cardiovascular thrombotic events. Patients with a recent MI who are treated with FELDENE should be monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

6. The label advises monitoring blood pressure during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy, as NSAIDs, including FELDENE, can lead to new-onset hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, contributing to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. (The drug itself is associated with the cardiotoxicity risk.)

7. FELDENE should be avoided in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. Patients with severe heart failure who are treated with FELDENE should be monitored for signs of worsening heart failure.

854,PITOLISANT HYDROCHLORIDE,"1. The drug WAKIX (pitolisant) has been associated with QT interval prolongation, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The use of WAKIX should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval.

2. WAKIX should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.

3. The risk of QT prolongation may be greater in patients with hepatic or renal impairment due to higher concentrations of pitolisant. Patients with hepatic or renal impairment should be monitored for increased QTc. Dosage modification is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and moderate or severe renal impairment.

4. WAKIX at the highest recommended dosage led to a QTc increase, and exposures higher than recommended doses increased QTc. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with QT interval prolongation and cardiotoxicity risks.

5. The drug label also mentions that WAKIX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and it is contraindicated in such patients due to the potential for increased exposure to the drug, which can lead to cardiotoxicity risks.

860,POMALIDOMIDE,"1. The drug label warns about venous and arterial thromboembolism risks associated with POMALYST, stating that deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke can occur in patients with multiple myeloma treated with POMALYST. Antithrombotic prophylaxis is recommended. (The drug itself is associated with the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism.)

2. The label mentions that in Trial 2, where anticoagulant therapies were mandated, thromboembolic events occurred in patients treated with POMALYST and low-dose dexamethasone. Venous thromboembolic events occurred in a higher percentage of patients treated with POMALYST compared to those treated with high-dose dexamethasone. (The drug itself is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.)

3. Additionally, the label highlights that arterial thromboembolic events, including ischemic cerebrovascular conditions and ischemic heart disease, were observed in patients treated with POMALYST. The occurrence of these events was higher in patients receiving POMALYST compared to those on high-dose dexamethasone. (The drug itself is associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events.)

4. The label also mentions that patients with known risk factors, such as prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk of thromboembolic events when treated with POMALYST. It recommends taking actions to minimize modifiable risk factors and suggests thromboprophylaxis based on the patient's underlying risk factors. (The drug itself is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events in patients with multiple myeloma.)

5. Furthermore, the label warns about the potential for increased mortality in patients with multiple myeloma when pembrolizumab is added to a thalidomide analogue and dexamethasone. It states that this combination resulted in increased mortality in clinical trials. (The combination of pembrolizumab with a thalidomide analogue and dexamethasone, not specifically POMALYST alone, is associated with increased mortality.)

6. The label advises monitoring patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia, when using POMALYST for multiple myeloma. It mentions that neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse event in clinical trials. (The drug itself is associated with hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia.)

7. Additionally, the label highlights the risk of hepatotoxicity with POMALYST, including cases of hepatic failure, elevated liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels.

894,PROPOFOL,"1. The drug label warns that DIPRIVAN has been associated with arterial hypotension during induction of anesthesia, especially when ventilation is assisted or controlled, which can lead to a decrease in cardiac output. This effect is more pronounced compared to other intravenous induction agents, suggesting that DIPRIVAN itself is associated with cardiotoxicity risks.

2. Additionally, the label mentions that during maintenance of general anesthesia with DIPRIVAN, there may be a decrease in spontaneous minute ventilation and an increase in carbon dioxide tension, which can further impact cardiac function. This suggests that DIPRIVAN may contribute to cardiotoxicity reactions during the maintenance phase of anesthesia.

3. The label also highlights that during monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation with DIPRIVAN, attention should be given to cardiorespiratory effects such as hypotension, oxyhemoglobin desaturation, apnea, and airway obstruction, especially following rapid bolus administration. This indicates that DIPRIVAN itself can lead to cardiotoxicity reactions in patients undergoing MAC sedation.

4. Furthermore, the label warns about the potential for DIPRIVAN infusions to cause metabolic derangements and organ system failures, known as Propofol Infusion Syndrome, which can result in severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac failure. This suggests that DIPRIVAN is associated with significant cardiotoxicity risks, especially in patients receiving prolonged, high-dose infusions.

While these reactions are not directly related to cardiotoxicity, they are common side effects of the drug.

3. **Clinical Pharmacology**: The label states that at the maximum tolerated dose of UPTRAVI tablets, the drug does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. This indicates that the drug itself is not associated with significant cardiac electrophysiological effects.

4. **Drug Interaction Studies**: In vitro studies show that selexipag and its active metabolite do not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and transport proteins at clinically relevant concentrations. This suggests that the drug is not likely to cause cardiotoxicity through interactions with these pathways.

1026,"SYNTHETIC CONJUGATED ESTROGENS, A","1. Estrogens, including synthetic conjugated estrogens in Cenestin, should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women during treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate relative to placebo. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.)

2. Estrogens have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. If any of these occur or are suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease and venous thromboembolism should be managed appropriately. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.)

3. In the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study, an increase in the number of strokes was observed in women receiving conjugated equine estrogens compared to placebo. The study also reported an increased risk of coronary heart disease events and stroke in women receiving conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate compared to placebo. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of strokes and coronary heart disease events.)

4. In the WHI study, an increase in venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, was observed in women receiving conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate compared to placebo. The rate of VTE was higher in the estrogen-progestin group than in the placebo group. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.)

5. Estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization. This precaution is due to the potential risk of thromboembolism associated with estrogen use. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism.)

6. Large doses of estrogen have been shown to increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis in men. This finding suggests a potential cardiotoxic effect of estrogen therapy. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in men.)

7. Estrogens have been associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women. This indicates a potential cardiotoxic effect of estrogen therapy. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease.)

8. Estrogens may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, estrogen therapy should be stopped, indicating a potential cardiotoxic effect of estrogen therapy. (The drug itself was associated with an increased risk of hypercalcemia.)

1059,TERAZOSIN,"1. The drug terazosin, an alpha-1-selective adrenoceptor blocking agent, has been associated with lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients due to its vasodilatory hypotensive action by blocking alpha-1-adrenoceptors. This effect is mainly responsible for decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance, leading to a gradual decrease in blood pressure within 15 minutes following oral administration.

2. In clinical trials, patients with mild or moderate hypertension who were administered terazosin experienced a decrease in blood pressure, with effects persisting throughout the dosing interval. The drug showed a greater blood pressure effect associated with peak plasma concentrations shortly after dosing, with a position-dependent increase in the erect position and a slight increase in heart rate in the first few hours after dosing.

3. Patients treated with terazosin may experience orthostatic hypotension, with symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and palpitations being common. The risk of orthostatic effects is greatest during the initial seven days of treatment but continues at all time intervals. Patients with occupations where such events could pose risks should be treated with caution.

4. In clinical trials, syncope (fainting) was reported in about 1% of hypertensive patients treated with terazosin, and syncope was not necessarily associated only with the first dose. If syncope occurs, patients should be placed in a recumbent position and treated supportively as necessary. The orthostatic effect of terazosin is greater shortly after dosing, and the risk of events is highest during the initial seven days of treatment but persists at all time intervals.

5. Rarely, terazosin and other alpha-1 antagonists have been associated with priapism (painful penile erection) in patients. Priapism is a serious condition that can lead to permanent impotence if not promptly treated. Patients must be advised about the seriousness of this condition and seek immediate medical attention if priapism occurs.",Less,No,Less,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

1067,TETRABENAZINE,"1. XENAZINE can cause a small increase in the corrected QT (QTc) interval, which may lead to the development of torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia. The risk of torsade de pointes increases with the degree of QT prolongation caused by XENAZINE. (The drug itself is associated with QT prolongation and the risk of torsade de pointes.)

2. XENAZINE should be avoided in combination with other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval, such as antipsychotic medications, antibiotics, and certain antiarrhythmic medications. (The drug itself is not causing cardiotoxicity but is associated with an increased risk when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs.)

3. XENAZINE should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and those with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as certain circumstances can further increase the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden death when using drugs that prolong the QTc interval. (The drug itself is not causing cardiotoxicity but is associated with an increased risk in specific patient populations.)

4. XENAZINE has been associated with postural dizziness in healthy volunteers, with one subject experiencing syncope and another subject having documented orthostasis. Monitoring of vital signs on standing should be considered in patients vulnerable to hypotension. (The drug itself is associated with postural dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.)

5. XENAZINE elevates serum prolactin concentrations, which can have implications for patients with prolactin-dependent conditions such as breast cancer. Chronic increase in serum prolactin levels has been associated with low estrogen levels and an increased risk of osteoporosis. If symptomatic hyperprolactinemia is suspected, appropriate laboratory testing should be done, and consideration should be given to discontinuing XENAZINE. (The drug itself is associated with hyperprolactinemia, which can have clinical implications for certain patients.)

6. XENAZINE binds to melanin-containing tissues, raising the possibility of accumulation and potential toxicity in these tissues over time. The clinical relevance of this binding is unknown, but prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. (The drug itself is associated with binding to melanin-containing tissues, which may lead to potential toxicity over extended use.)

In summary, XENAZINE is associated with cardiotoxicity risks such as QT prolongation and potential torsade de pointes, as well as other cardiovascular effects like postural dizziness and hyperprolactinemia. Prescribers should be cautious when using XENAZINE in patients with underlying cardiac conditions or those at risk for QT prolongation.",Less,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

1076,THIOTHIXENE,"1. The drug label warns about the risk of increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis when treated with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene. The label states that the risk of death in drug-treated patients was higher compared to placebo-treated patients, with most deaths attributed to cardiovascular or infectious causes. Thiothixene is not approved for treating patients with dementia-related psychosis.

2. The label mentions that thiothixene may cause cardiovascular effects such as tachycardia, hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope. It notes that nonspecific EKG changes have been observed in some patients receiving thiothixene, although the clinical significance of these changes is not known.

3. Thiothixene may lead to CNS effects like drowsiness, sedation, restlessness, agitation, and insomnia. Seizures and exacerbation of psychotic symptoms have been reported infrequently. Hyperreflexia has been observed in infants born to mothers who received structurally related drugs.

4. The drug label mentions that thiothixene can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, including pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, and dystonia. Management of these symptoms depends on the type and severity, with rapid relief requiring the use of antiparkinson agents.

5. Thiothixene may result in dystonia, characterized by prolonged abnormal muscle contractions, especially in susceptible individuals during the initial days of treatment. Symptoms include spasm of neck muscles, swallowing difficulty, and tongue protrusion. The risk of acute dystonia is higher in males and younger age groups.

6. The label warns about persistent tardive dyskinesia that may occur in some patients on long-term thiothixene therapy or after discontinuation. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw. Early detection is crucial, and patients should be monitored regularly.

7. Thiothixene may cause hepatic effects, including elevations in serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels. Although transient, these effects have been infrequently observed. No clinically confirmed cases of jaundice due to thiothixene have been reported.

8. Hematologic effects such as leukopenia, leukocytosis, and occasionally agranulocytosis can occur with thiothixene. Other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with various blood disorders like agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, and anemia.

9. Thiothixene may lead to allergic reactions like rash, pruritus, urticaria, and photosensitivity. Although rare, cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. Exposure to sunlight should be minimized to avoid adverse skin reactions.

1080,TIGECYCLINE,"1. **Warnings and Precautions:** Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with tigecycline, and may be life-threatening. Tigecycline is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibiotics and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibiotics. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk but may cause anaphylactic reactions.)

2. **Warnings and Precautions:** Hepatic Adverse Effects: Increases in total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time, and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been reported in patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. Hepatic dysfunction may occur after the drug has been discontinued. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk but may lead to hepatic adverse effects.)

3. **Warnings and Precautions:** Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis, including fatal cases, has occurred in association with tigecycline treatment. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be considered in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk factors for pancreatitis. Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having developed pancreatitis. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk but may lead to pancreatitis.)

4. **Warnings and Precautions:** Fetal Harm: Tigecycline may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking tigecycline, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Results of animal studies indicate that tigecycline crosses the placenta and is found in fetal tissues. Decreased fetal weights in rats and rabbits (with associated delays in ossification) and fetal loss in rabbits have been observed with tigecycline. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk but may cause fetal harm.)

5. **Warnings and Precautions:** Tooth Discoloration: The use of tigecycline during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). Results of studies in rats with tigecycline have shown bone discoloration. Tigecycline should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. (The drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risk but may cause tooth discoloration.)

6. **Warnings and Precautions:** Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD): Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. (The drug itself is not directly associated with cardiotoxicity risk but may lead to CDAD.)",Less,No,Less,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.

The drug label mentions that THIOLA® may potentially cause serious adverse reactions reported for d-penicillamine, including complications such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, Goodpasture’s syndrome, or myasthenia gravis. It is noted that no deaths have been directly reported from THIOLA® treatment, but a fatal outcome is possible, similar to what has been reported with d-penicillamine therapy. (The drug itself is associated with the potential cardiotoxicity risk.)

2. The label also warns that leukopenia of the granulocytic series may develop without eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia may be immunologic in origin or occur on an idiosyncratic basis. It is emphasized that a reduction in peripheral blood white count to less than 3500/cubic mm or in platelet count to below 100,000 cubic mm mandates cessation of therapy. Patients are advised to report promptly any symptoms or signs of these hematological abnormalities. (The drug itself is associated with the potential cardiotoxicity risk.)

3. Proteinuria, sometimes severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome, may develop from membranous glomerulopathy. Close observation of affected patients is deemed mandatory. The label mentions that the following complications, though rare, have been reported during d-penicillamine therapy and could occur during THIOLA® treatment. It is advised that when abnormal urinary findings are associated with hemoptysis and pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of Goodpasture’s syndrome, THIOLA® treatment should be stopped. (The drug itself is associated with the potential cardiotoxicity risk.)

4. The label further states that jaundice and abnormal liver function tests have been reported during THIOLA® therapy for non-cystinuric conditions. While a direct cause-and-effect relationship has not been established based on these reports, patients should be carefully monitored, and if any abnormalities are noted, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate measures. (The drug itself is associated with the potential cardiotoxicity risk.)

1092,TOLTERODINE TARTRATE,"1. The drug label mentions that tolterodine, the active ingredient in Detrol LA, was evaluated for its effect on the QT interval in a study involving healthy volunteers. The study showed that tolterodine at doses of 2 mg and 4 mg had an effect on the QT interval, with a mean increase in heart rate associated with the drug. This indicates that tolterodine itself was associated with QT interval changes, which can be a risk factor for cardiotoxicity.

2. The label also states that the effect of tolterodine on the QT interval was found to correlate with plasma concentration of the drug. Additionally, the study suggested that there was a greater QT interval increase in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers after tolterodine treatment. This information implies that tolterodine itself can impact the QT interval, potentially leading to cardiotoxicity in certain individuals based on their metabolic profile.

3. Furthermore, the label mentions that the QT effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets appeared greater at higher doses, such as 8 mg/day, compared to lower doses like 4 mg/day. The study also noted that the effect of tolterodine at 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed with the active control moxifloxacin. This suggests that tolterodine itself may have a dose-dependent effect on the QT interval, which is a known risk factor for cardiotoxicity.

4. It is important to note that the drug label specifies that there has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with Detrol or Detrol LA.

1102,TRANYLCYPROMINE SULFATE,"1. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: The drug PARNATE, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), has been associated with hypertensive crises caused by the ingestion of foods or beverages with high tyramine content. It may also lead to hypertensive reactions and crises with concomitant use of other drugs. Patients with hyperthyroidism may be at greater risk of hypertensive crisis.

2. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Clinically significant increases in blood pressure have been reported after the administration of MAOIs, including PARNATE, in patients not ingesting tyramine-rich foods or beverages. Blood pressure should be assessed before prescribing PARNATE, and close monitoring is necessary for all patients taking the drug.

3. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Patients should be instructed to avoid foods and beverages with high tyramine content while being treated with PARNATE and for 2 weeks after stopping the medication. Careful evaluation of the benefits and risks of PARNATE therapy is essential in patients with hypertension or confirmed/suspected cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disorders that increase the risk for complications from severe hypertension.

4. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: In patients taking PARNATE, blood pressure should be closely monitored to detect evidence of increased blood pressure. Full reliance should not be placed solely on blood pressure readings, and patients should be observed for other signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis.

5. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Therapy should be interrupted with symptoms that may be prodromal or a manifestation of a hypertensive crisis, and patients should be evaluated immediately. Discontinuation of PARNATE, other drugs, foods, or beverages suspected to contribute to the hypertensive crisis should be done promptly.

6. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Patients with severe elevations in blood pressure require immediate blood pressure reduction. Fever should be managed by external cooling, and additional measures to control the causes of hyperthermia may be necessary.

7. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Postural hypotension, a major adverse reaction at doses above 30 mg daily, may result in syncope. Symptoms of postural hypotension are commonly seen in patients with pre-existing hypertension. Blood pressure usually returns to pretreatment levels upon discontinuation of PARNATE.

8. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Dosage increases should be made more gradually in patients with a tendency toward hypotension and/or postural hypotension, especially in elderly patients. Patients should be closely observed for postural changes in blood pressure throughout treatment.

9. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Postural hypotension may be relieved by having patients lie down until blood pressure returns to normal. When PARNATE is used concomitantly with other agents known to cause hypotension, the possibility of additive hypotensive effects should be considered.

10. **Hypertensive Crisis and Hypertension**: Careful consideration of the risk of agents and techniques that increase the risk for hypotension or other adverse reactions to PARNATE is necessary during anesthesia and perioperative care.

1105,TRIAMTERENE CAPSULES,"1. The drug Triamterene, a potassium-sparing diuretic, may occasionally cause increases in serum potassium levels, which can result in hyperkalemia. This risk is associated with the drug itself.
   
2. Unchecked hyperkalemia can be fatal, especially in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, the elderly, or those who are severely ill. Serum potassium levels must be monitored frequently, particularly when patients are on Triamterene, when dosages are changed, or during any illness that may affect renal function. This cardiotoxicity risk is associated with the drug itself.

3. There have been isolated reports of hypersensitivity reactions to Triamterene, necessitating regular observation for blood dyscrasias, liver damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions. This risk is associated with the drug itself.

4. If hyperkalemia is present or suspected, an electrocardiogram should be obtained to assess for cardiac irregularities. In the presence of hyperkalemia, discontinuing Triamterene and any potassium supplementation, and substituting with a thiazide alone may be sufficient. Additional therapies may be required for a widened QRS complex or arrhythmia. This cardiotoxicity risk is associated with the drug itself.

5. Triamterene tends to conserve potassium, potentially leading to increases in serum potassium levels and, in rare instances, hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia has been associated with cardiac irregularities. This risk is associated with the drug itself.

6. Electrolyte imbalance, often seen in conditions like congestive heart failure, renal disease, or cirrhosis, may be exacerbated or independently caused by effective diuretics like Triamterene. The use of full diuretic doses with restricted salt intake can result in a low-salt syndrome. This cardiotoxicity risk is associated with the drug itself.

7. Triamterene can cause mild nitrogen retention, which is reversible upon drug withdrawal, and may rarely lead to metabolic acidosis. This cardiotoxicity risk is associated with the drug itself.

8. Triamterene may elevate uric acid levels, especially in individuals predisposed to gouty arthritis. This risk is associated with the drug itself.

9. Triamterene has been reported in renal stones in association with other calculus components, cautioning its use in patients with a history of renal stones. This risk is associated with the drug itself.

10. In the event of overdosage of Triamterene, electrolyte imbalance, particularly hyperkalemia, is a major concern. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbances, and weakness. Immediate evacuation of the stomach should be induced, and careful evaluation of electrolyte balance should be conducted.

1107,TRICLABENDAZOLE,"1. The drug EGATEN (triclabendazole) is associated with QT prolongation, which can lead to prolongation of the QTc interval. The magnitude of QTc prolongation can increase with increasing treatment duration of EGATEN. Administration of EGATEN concurrently with certain medications or in patients with hepatic impairment may increase the risk for QT prolongation. (Drug-associated cardiotoxicity risk)

2. Patients with a history of prolongation of the QTc interval, symptoms compatible with a long QT interval, electrolyte imbalance like hypokalemia, or those taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval should have their electrocardiogram (ECG) monitored while using EGATEN. If signs of cardiac arrhythmia occur during treatment with EGATEN, the treatment should be stopped, and ECG monitoring should continue. (Drug-associated cardiotoxicity risk)

3. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions associated with triclabendazole at a dose of 20 mg/kg include abdominal pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, and chest discomfort. These reactions may be indicative of cardiotoxicity and should be monitored closely during treatment with EGATEN. (Cardiotoxicity reactions)

The label states that Tham Solution has been found to be beneficial in correcting metabolic acidosis during or after cardiac bypass surgery, which may involve cardiotoxicity risks due to the underlying cardiac conditions. (Associated with cardiotoxicity risk)

2. The label also notes that Tham Solution may be added directly to ACD blood used for priming the pump-oxygenator during cardiac bypass surgery to correct the acidity of the blood. This suggests that the drug itself is not associated with cardiotoxicity risks but is used to address acid-base imbalances in the context of cardiac procedures. (Not associated with cardiotoxicity risk)

3. In cases of cardiac arrest, Tham Solution may be administered intraventricularly to correct acidosis and help in resuscitative efforts. The label mentions that Tham Solution has been effective in correcting acidosis and aiding in the response to resuscitative efforts in some cases of cardiac arrest. While the drug is not directly linked to causing cardiac arrest, its use in this context may involve cardiotoxicity risks due to the critical condition of the patients. (Associated with cardiotoxicity risk)

4. The label advises that Tham Solution should be administered slowly and in amounts sufficient to correct existing acidosis, to avoid overdosage and alkalosis, which can lead to hypoglycemia. It also mentions that overdosage in terms of total drug and/or too rapid administration may cause prolonged hypoglycemia. These warnings highlight the importance of careful dosing and monitoring to prevent adverse effects, including potential cardiotoxicity reactions. (Associated with cardiotoxicity risk)

5. The label cautions that large doses of Tham Solution may depress ventilation, leading to increased blood pH and reduced CO2 concentration, which can impact respiratory function.

1140,VARENICLINE TARTRATE,"1. Cardiovascular Events: Patients with underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease may be at increased risk of CV events when using CHANTIX. The drug was associated with an increased incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and nonfatal stroke compared to placebo in a smoking cessation trial. However, all-cause and CV mortality was lower in patients treated with CHANTIX. Patients should be instructed to notify their healthcare providers of new or worsening CV symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of MI or stroke. (CHANTIX was associated with an increased risk of CV events in patients with underlying CV disease.)

2. A meta-analysis of 15 CHANTIX efficacy trials showed an increased hazard ratio for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) of 1.95, although the finding was not statistically significant. Few MACE events occurred during the trial, and the findings did not contribute substantively to the understanding of CV risk with CHANTIX. (CHANTIX was not statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE in the meta-analysis.)

3. The comprehensive evaluation of CV risk with CHANTIX suggests that patients with underlying CV disease may be at increased risk of CV events. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers of new or worsening CV symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of MI or stroke. (CHANTIX was associated with an increased risk of CV events in patients with underlying CV disease.)

4. In a large postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial, an analysis of adjudicated MACE events was conducted for patients while in the trial and during a 28-week non-treatment extension period. Few MACE events occurred during the trial, and the findings did not contribute substantively to the understanding of CV risk with CHANTIX. (CHANTIX was not associated with a significant increase in MACE events in the postmarketing trial.)

In summary, CHANTIX has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Patients should be closely monitored for new or worsening CV symptoms, and immediate medical attention should be sought if signs of myocardial infarction or stroke are experienced while using CHANTIX.",Less,Yes,Most,"Provide a summary of all the parts of the drug label that discuss cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxicity reactions for this drug.
