Acetaminophen is often found combined with other drugs in more than 600 over the counter (OTC) allergy medications, cold medications, sleep medications, pain relievers, and other products.[L5783] Confusion about dosing of this drug may be caused by the availability of different formulas, strengths, and dosage instructions for children of different ages.[L5783] Due to the possibility of fatal overdose and liver failure associated with the incorrect use of acetaminophen, it is important to follow current and available national and manufacturer dosing guidelines while this drug is taken or prescribed.[L5786,L5789,Label]",151.1626,CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(O)C=C1,0.46,362O9ITL9D,,"Zee Painaid Back Relief Formula|Medique Pain Off|Daytime Flu Relief Therapy|Day Severe Cold Night Cold and Flu|Orb-acetaminophen 325 Mg Caplets|Mucus Relief Cold, Flu and Sore Throat|Non-Drowsy Sinus Severe, Circle K|Severe Sinus Congestion and Pain Daytime|Head Congestion and Mucus|PMS-acetaminophen Tab 500mg|Children's Acetaminophen Dps 80mg/ml|Capital and Codeine|Ultra Headache Relief|Cold and Flu Severe Day Time / Night Time|Xpect Cold Relief|Little Remedies Infant Fever/Pain Reliever|DayTime Sinus Relief|Maximum Strength Mucinex Sinus-Max Severe Congestion and Pain|Shoprite Sinus Congestion and Pain|Acetaminophen and Diphenhydramine hydrochloride|Extra Strength Sinus Medication-caplet|Children Acetaminophen Grape Flavored Chewable|TYLENOL with Codeine|SEVERE COLD AND FLU DAYTIME NON DROWSY and NIGHTTIME|Alka-Seltzer Plus Day and Night Cold and Flu Formula|Acetaminophen 500mg Diphenhydramine HCl 25mg|Childrens Acetaminophen Liquid|Goodys Cool Orange|Excedrin Menstrual Complete|Sudafed PE Sinus Pressure Plus Pain|SUDAFED PE Pressure Plus Pain|Acetaminophen Liquid Gel Capsules|Flu Relief Therapy|Extra Strength Sinus Relief|Grippalin & C Tab|Vicks Cough and Cold Severe|CareOne Childrens Pain and Fever|Daytime Non Drows Cold and Flu and Nighttime Cold and|Maximum Strength Nighttime Cold/Flu Relief|QPAP Infants Drops|Night Relief sinus|Acetaminophen,Caffeine and Pyrilamine Maleate|Sinus PE Head Congestion and Mucus|Pain Reliever 2|Tylenol Complete Cold, Cough & Flu Nighttime|Night Time Cold and Flu original|Tylenol W Codeine No2 Tab|Leader Flu and Severe Cold and Cough|Topcare Clear Time|4104 First Aid Kit|Easy Care First Aid -

It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]

On the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194]",206.2808,CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(O)=O,3.97,WK2XYI10QM,D0YGZ1VO1B,"Childrens Novufen Ibuprofen|Childrens Ibuprofen 100|Nuprin Immediate Release|Prastera|Junior Strength Motrin

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]",435.5188,CCCCC(=O)N(CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1C1=NNN=N1)[C@@H](C(C)C)C(O)=O,1.499,80M03YXJ7I,,"Neparvis|Ava-valsartan HCT|Auro-valsartan HCT|Diovan HCT|Q-valsartan|Diovan 160mg|Amlodipine and Valsartan|Imprida|Teva-valsartan|Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide|Exforge|M-valsartan|Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide|Dafiro|Entresto|Riva-valsartan|Novo-valsartan/hctz|Dafiro HCT|Valturna|Copalia HCT|Prexxartan|Diovan 80mg|Mylan-valsartan|Novo-valsartan|Amlodipine, Valsartan, Hydrochlorothiazide|Apo-valsartan|Amlodipine, Valsartan, and Hydrochlorothiazide|PMS-valsartan|Apo-valsartan/hctz|Diovan 160mg Tablets|Q-valsartan Hctz|Valsartan|Reddy-valsartan|Exforge HCT|Copalia|Diovan 80mg Tablets|AMLODIPINE and VALSARTAN|Amlodipine, Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide|Amlodipine-valsartan Mylan|Valsartan HCT|Valsartan/htcz|Sandoz Valsartan HCT|Imprida HCT|Teva-valsartan/hctz|Act Valsartan|Auro-valsartan|Diovan-hct|PMS-valsartan-hctz|Mylan-valsartan Hctz|Taro-valsartan|Valsartan-hctz|Amlodipine and valsartan|Diovan|Ava-valsartan|Sandoz Valsartan|Dom-valsartan|Byvalson|Valsartan HCTZ",2016-09-07|2016-11-08|2014-09-10|2015-06-03|2008-12-04|2016-06-22|2012-04-02|2014-12-03|2017-03-17|2014-11-13|2014-10-10|2018-03-30|2010-12-28|2008-11-25|2014-07-21|2006-04-28|2017-12-19|2021-11-02|2021-06-29|2016-04-07|2007-06-20|2013-03-21|2016-08-29|2018-05-21|2016-04-22|2016-09-19|2001-07-01|2012-04-27|2017-08-01|2017-07-06|2013-03-20|2009-01-02|2021-06-25|2011-02-16|2019-02-07|2016-06-03|1997-12-15|2014-05-06|2019-02-15|2015-07-07|2022-07-28|2019-03-14|2014-12-01|2015-04-30|2018-01-02|2015-06-01|2016-09-08|2020-06-23|2012-07-12|2011-01-27|2007-02-14|2022-03-17|2022-07-25|2015-08-31|2018-09-11|2015-04-27|2011-11-15|2015-03-31|2019-02-22|2012-06-10|2014-09-08|2019-10-08|2015-02-15|2015-03-30|2018-06-29|2022-07-15|2016-07-26|2016-06-01|2016-03-04|2016-12-15|2016-11-02|2015-01-05|2021-04-16|2019-09-10|2011-05-30|2009-06-22|2019-10-09|2010-01-06|2017-08-03|2016-01-27|2017-12-29|2020-03-05|2010-05-14|2016-08-12|2012-05-22|2000-05-10|2015-02-20|2015-01-07|2014-04-22|2020-07-03|2016-12-01|2016-06-29|2016-04-06|1998-03-06|2011-09-28|2014-02-03|2009-09-16|2007-06-15|2009-03-05|2013-06-19|2015-01-01|2021-06-23|2016-05-20|2007-09-17|2013-03-08|2022-10-24|2015-06-04|2015-01-06|2022-06-27|2012-02-28|2013-09-16|2003-01-24|2005-11-01|2009-04-04|2011-03-25|2022-04-04|2022-09-01|2021-01-12|2008-02-28|2015-05-20|2014-07-07|2018-05-14|2014-02-06|2020-12-16|2013-04-19|2015-01-29|2015-04-24|2015-11-13|2014-02-28|2011-08-18|2016-07-07|2016-08-01|2018-01-19|2014-09-30|2016-09-09|1996-12-23|2021-10-27|2020-07-01|2015-10-31|2020-02-12|2017-01-19|2008-05-12|2013-10-31|2012-07-20|2012-09-21|2017-06-14|2014-01-09|2015-11-12|2019-04-09|2007-08-15|2018-05-04|2016-05-24|2022-12-01,Canada|EU|US,Nephrotoxic,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,,Valsartan,C09CA03,80,mg,,

The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA during reverse transcription. It improves immunologic function, partially reverses the HIV-induced neurological dysfunction, and improves certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. Its principal toxic effect is dose-dependent suppression of bone marrow, resulting in anemia and leukopenia.

NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]",357.788,COC1=CC2=C(C=C1)N(C(=O)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1)C(C)=C2CC(O)=O,4.27,XXE1CET956,0IMX38M2GG,Sandoz Indomethacin|Indocid SR 75mg|Indocid Cap 25mg|Apo Indomethacin Cap 25mg|Novo-methacin - Sup 50mg|Indocin|Ftp-indomethacin|Rhodacine - Sup 100mg|Rhodacine - Cap 25mg|Teva-indomethacin|Ratio-indomethacin|Indomethacin Extended-release|Indomethacin|Nu-indo Cap 25mg|Ntp-indomethacin|Indomethacin Extended-Release|Indomethacin extended-release|Indocid Sup 100mg|Nu-indo Cap 50mg|Indocid Sterile Oph Susp 1%|Tivorbex|Rhodacine - Sup 50mg|Rhodacine - Cap 50mg|Pro-indo 50 Cap 50mg|Indocid Sup 50mg|Indocollyre|Auro-indomethacin|Indomethacin ER|Pro-indo 25 Cap 25mg|Mint-indomethacin|Apo Indomethacin Cap 50mg|Indocid Cap 50mg|Novo-methacin - 100mg Sup,2016-11-16|1965-12-31|2020-11-20|2012-08-10|2021-12-30|1996-11-28|1984-04-20|2015-06-19|1997-11-17|2007-12-14|2015-07-06|1997-01-21|2017-02-21|1986-02-12|2017-04-20|2018-02-08|2020-02-04|1984-08-06|2019-05-29|2015-10-05|2004-08-02|1998-09-15|2013-05-16|2010-03-04|2019-01-01|2017-11-21|2016-10-21|1985-01-30|1987-04-29|1985-10-10|2016-04-05|2017-05-10|2010-12-22|2010-07-30|2019-01-21|2015-06-01|2021-05-15|2021-07-08|1990-12-31|1998-05-28|2015-07-24|2017-06-22|2013-11-15|2022-05-04|2015-07-14|2015-10-22|2010-11-30|2021-12-10|2011-11-21|2015-09-15|1992-08-31|2015-05-19|1993-12-31|2019-04-11|2006-05-02|1997-02-13|2012-07-27|2018-10-10|2011-04-12|2008-08-01|2021-10-05|2010-02-08|2006-01-09|1971-12-31|2011-01-11|2013-09-24|2016-08-16|2016-05-19|2010-10-07|1983-12-31|2017-01-31|2016-07-21|2011-11-01|2018-10-03|2015-01-01|2013-03-19|2014-08-26|2010-07-10|2010-11-08|2016-10-07|1999-07-27|2010-12-06|1995-04-26|1985-12-31|2013-05-13|2010-02-11|2017-07-05|2009-03-06|1980-12-31|2017-02-23|2019-02-12|2017-02-22|2013-03-18|1970-12-31|2012-08-13|2015-05-20|2011-09-08|1984-12-31|2017-08-25|1986-03-05|2010-10-29|2007-04-01|2013-04-23|2006-09-19|2019-06-20|2017-05-08|2019-06-25|2016-12-27|1995-12-31|2016-08-05|2021-07-27|2011-04-20|2010-09-15|2017-04-03|2013-01-21|2016-10-06|2014-01-01|2010-03-19|1998-10-09|2019-02-04|2017-03-13|2017-12-01|2016-07-19|2018-01-18|1998-09-10|2020-01-03|2010-07-16,Canada|US,Nephrotoxic,,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/bf11f5a0-f2ee-499a-8d54-9d557cc66841/spl-doc ,Indometacin,M01AB01,0.1,g,,"It's miss-spelled as ""Indometacin"""

Its actions are mediated by enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid activity. It is used in the treatment of severe anxiety disorders, as a hypnotic in the short-term management of insomnia, as a sedative and premedicant, as an anticonvulsant, and in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

Given diazepam's storied history as a commonly used and effective medication for a variety of indications, contemporary advancements in the formulation and administration of the agent include the development and US FDA approval of an auto-injectable formulation for the rapid treatment of uncontrolled seizures in 2015-2016 [L5200]. Combining diazepam, a proven effective therapy for acute repetitive seizures, with an auto-injector designed for subcutaneous administration that is quickly and easily administered offers the potential for complete, consistent drug absorption and rapid onset of effect [L5200]. This current development is subsequently an important addition to the rescue therapy tool chest for patients with epilepsy [L5200].",284.74,CN1C2=C(C=C(Cl)C=C2)C(=NCC1=O)C1=CC=CC=C1,2.82,Q3JTX2Q7TU,6JD21U639H,Diazepam Injection Sdz|Diastat|E Pam Tab 5mg|Valtoco|Diazepam Intensol|Diazemuls|E Pam Tab 10mg|Diazepam 10mg Tablets|Valium 5 Tab|Meval 5|Valium Inj Roche 5mg/ml|Diazepam Autoinjector|Diazepam 2tab 2mg|Meval 2|Diazepam 5 Tab|Valium 10 Tab|PMS-diazepam|Diazepam|Vivol|Valium|Topical Nerve Pain|Novo-dipam Tab 10mg|E Pam Tab 2mg|Diazepam 2mg Tablets|Bio-diazepam|Diazepam 5mg Tablets|Diazepam 10tab 10mg|Diazepam Injection USP|Novo-dipam Tab 2mg|PMS-diazepam Solution 1mg/ml|Novo-dipam Tab 5mg|Gabavale-5|Topical Pain,1985-12-16|2016-11-16|2010-12-31|2004-06-03|1979-12-31|2017-03-16|2011-10-13|2019-03-22|2016-04-11|2005-08-23|2015-05-05|1985-09-04|2011-11-29|2008-06-05|2018-12-06|1987-04-03|2015-07-21|2016-03-08|2018-07-13|1997-11-04|2006-11-15|1997-07-29|1986-11-01|2000-01-28|2006-08-16|2019-02-07|1990-06-30|2017-11-01|2019-08-09|2017-01-23|2016-01-25|2016-11-01|2016-12-12|2022-11-04|2003-12-10|2010-04-13|1990-09-30|1987-10-13|2001-08-17|2013-03-27|2002-01-29|2012-01-17|2007-06-06|2013-07-03|2022-12-05|1974-12-31|2020-01-29|2009-11-09|2022-04-21|2006-03-31|2018-06-20|2007-08-02|1997-10-31|2019-08-16|2007-01-24|2021-05-18|2019-10-31|2019-12-01|2011-11-09|2008-07-23|2019-08-27|2007-10-05|1963-11-15|1986-12-10|2011-08-01|2011-12-11|2011-05-07|2022-01-10|2016-02-23|1987-02-03|2009-11-20|2013-01-01|1990-12-05|2016-11-04|2016-07-21|2022-10-20|2009-01-15|2002-01-03|2015-01-01|2016-06-10|2021-08-24|2019-11-18|2008-01-01|2010-06-01|1973-12-31|2009-12-09|2016-08-03|1980-12-31|1970-12-31|2022-04-04|2011-03-29|2010-09-03|2002-02-13|2014-04-14|2008-08-19|2019-08-20|1995-12-31|2019-08-01|1978-12-31|2003-04-23|2016-11-30|2019-09-19|2020-07-01|1977-12-31|2015-10-06|2012-02-22|2006-05-01|1992-12-31|2017-09-21|2009-10-13|1968-12-31|2017-04-05|2019-10-10|2020-01-10|2016-06-24|2019-07-10|2014-01-01|2007-04-17|1988-12-20|2018-07-30|2010-10-01,Canada|US,Nephrotoxic,,Non-Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/b326c66d-5762-4d16-933c-619fa2088ccd/spl-doc ,Diazepam,N05BA01,10,mg,,

It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites.

In particular, as colestipol's general mechanism of action ultimately results in the decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bile acids and lipids in the feces, patients who take complicated medication regimens, experience constipation or biliary obstruction, etc. may not be good candidates for using the agent owing to its physical effects on the gut.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262]

However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties [L5269, F3352]. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for ""night time"" use [L5263, L5281, L5287]. 

Diphenhydramine is also used in combination with [DB14132] as the anti-nausea drug [DB00985] where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system [A1540].

Diphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and opioid [A1539]. As a result, diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties.",255.3547,CN(C)CCOC(C1=CC=CC=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1,3.27,8GTS82S83M,4OD433S209,"Allergy Care|DG Anti-Itch|Acetaminophen and Diphenhydramine hydrochloride|WinCo Original Strength Anti-Itch|Acetaminophen 500mg Diphenhydramine HCl 25mg|Sleep Eze D Caplet 25mg|Flu Relief Therapy|Childrens Nighttime Cold and Cough|Leader Flu and Severe Cold and Cough|Topcare Clear Time|Nightime Sleep Aid|Nytol|Equate Flu and Severe Cold and Cough|Pain Reliever PM Extra Strength|Nighttime Liquigel Sleep-aid|TopCare Allergy Relief|Allergy and Cold Relief|Allergy Childrens Allergy|Buckley's Nighttime Cough & Congestion|Sinus Pressure and Pain Daytime Nighttime Maximum Strength|Pain Reliever and Sleep Aid|Extra Strength Nitetime Sleep Aid Gel Caps|Ibuprofen Nighttime|Sinus Relief Day Night|NIGHTTIME SLEEP AID Maximum Strength|Welly Childrens Travel Medicine|End-A-flu Multi-symptom Severe Cold and Cough Nighttime Formula|Wal Dryl Allergy Childrens|Leader Night Time Cough and Cold Childrens Triacting|CVS cough and severe cold night time honey lemon infused with chamomile and white tea flavors|Care One Pain Relief and Pain Relief PM|Dr Cocoa Day Night Combo|Benadryl ReadyMist Itch Stopping|ZzzQuil Alcohol Free Nighttime Sleep-Aid|Nighttime Sleep Aid Maximum Strength|Aller-aide Plus Capsules 50mg|Allergy Elixir|AcetaFlu NightTime Effervescent|DG Health Tussin|Itch and Bite Relief First Aid Kit|Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride 50 Mg Capsules USP Extra Strength Sleep Aid|Benadryl Total|After Bite Outdoor|Diphenhydramine HCl Injection, USP|Cold and Flu Severe Night|Triaminic Nighttime Cough and Cold|Childrens Delsym Cough Plus Chest Congestion DM and Delsym Cough Plus Cold Night Time|Rexall Sleep Aid|Dimetane Allergy Tablets|Extra Strength Nytol Tab 50mg|Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride 25mg|Quality Choice Nighttime Severe Cold and Cough Honey Lemon infused with Chamomile and White Tea Flavors|Wal-Dryl Allergy Plus Cold|Family Wellness flu and severe cold and cough nighttime|Cold and Cough|severe cold and sinus relief PE|NightTime Pain Reliever PM|Robitussin Honey Severe Cough, Flu Plus Sore Throat Nighttime|Plus Pharma Extra Strength Acetaminophen PM|healthy mama eaZZZe THE PAIN|MAXIMUM STRENGTH Nighttime Sleep Aid|Ibuprofen Daytime, Ibuprofen Nighttime|Sleepaid Extra Strength Capsules|Aller-aide|Benadryl PE Total Regular Strength|CVS Extra Strength Itch Stopping|Best Choice Nighttime Severe Cold and Cough Honey Lemon infused with Chamomile and White Tea Flavors|Severe Allergy Plus Sinus Headache|Best Choice Itch Stopping|Wal-Dryl Allergy Dye-Free|Aurophen PM Extra Strength|Good Sense Naproxen Sodium|Wal-Sleep Z Nighttime|Pain Relief Medicine PM|Triaminic Day -

The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990s, after the intravenous administration of radiolabelled ezetimibe in rats revealed that it was being localized within enterocytes of the intestinal villi - this prompted studies investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption.[A15202] Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to a healthy diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).[L11347]

Unlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is unique in that it does not affect the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids.[A33313] In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen, and these mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment - it was determined based on these findings that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway.[A15202] By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver.[L11347]",409.4252,[H][C@]1(CC[C@H](O)C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)C(=O)N(C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)[C@]1([H])C1=CC=C(O)C=C1,,EOR26LQQ24,,Gln-ezetimibe|Zetia|Sandoz Ezetimibe|Bio-ezetimibe|Jamp-ezetimibe|M-ezetimibe|Ezetimibe|Nustendi|Mylan-ezetimibe|Auro-ezetimibe|Mar-ezetimibe|Ipg-ezetimibe|Riva-ezetimibe|Mint-ezetimibe|Nexlizet|Roszet|Ran-ezetimibe|Act Ezetimibe|Ezetrol|Liptruzet|PMS-ezetimibe|Priva-ezetimibe|Vytorin|Ach-ezetimibe|Teva-ezetimibe|Lypqozet|Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe|Ezetimibe and Simvastatin|Apo-ezetimibe|Ag-ezetimibe|Nra-ezetimibe,2016-12-12|2021-01-14|2017-08-25|2018-09-24|2019-03-13|2018-12-10|2010-09-27|2004-11-19|2002-10-25|2019-08-12|2018-07-20|2015-07-09|2018-08-14|2018-04-25|2012-03-19|2019-08-19|2004-07-23|2018-09-06|2014-09-17|2014-10-08|2011-07-29|2013-10-04|2021-05-10|2018-02-03|2014-09-16|2018-11-20|2002-12-26|2011-04-10|2019-02-05|2021-06-01|2017-06-12|2022-11-29|2017-07-02|2013-05-03|2017-12-23|2022-04-29|2010-08-27|2022-06-30|2017-04-26|2022-10-04|2017-06-15|2019-07-23|2017-08-09|2020-10-23|2017-12-24|2021-02-01|2021-08-15|2005-03-14|2021-02-10|2005-04-04|2017-11-21|2017-12-14|2019-10-07|2020-03-09|2009-07-27|2020-12-02|2014-09-15|2019-03-01|2019-01-09|2014-09-23|2022-01-16|2017-01-26|2022-08-20|2003-06-15|2022-02-13|2019-06-27,Canada|EU|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/462ee7a6-8246-4b04-8465-bb07aae0e739/spl-doc?hl=ezetimibe ,Ezetimibe,C10AX09,10,mg,,

Felodipine is the most potent CCB in use and is unique in that it exhibits fluorescent activity. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels.

Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily.",490.62,CCC1=C(C)CN(C(=O)NCCC2=CC=C(C=C2)S(=O)(=O)NC(=O)N[C@H]2CC[C@H](C)CC2)C1=O,,6KY687524K,,Avandaryl|Co Glimepiride|Novo-glimepiride|Tandemact|Avaglim|Glimepiride|Apo-glimepiride|PMS-glimepiride|Ratio-glimepiride|Pioglitazone hydrochloride and glimepiride|Pioglitazone and Glimepiride|Amaryl|Sandoz Glimepiride|Duetact,2016-09-07|2013-06-13|2009-09-22|2020-06-01|2014-05-23|2009-08-17|2019-03-20|2014-07-21|2015-02-04|2019-02-25|2017-01-30|2016-11-17|2006-07-28|2011-05-24|2005-10-19|2018-09-10|2021-10-06|2013-10-08|2006-08-15|2017-11-21|2000-09-18|2019-05-21|2015-10-01|2015-04-21|2006-08-25|2016-01-25|2013-01-03|2016-02-04|2017-12-26|2016-09-08|2020-04-03|2007-09-29|2015-07-14|2013-05-09|2020-04-01|2014-12-29|2017-02-24|2014-02-26|2007-05-22|2010-10-14|2015-08-04|2006-04-24|2016-07-13|2021-08-16|2020-05-21|2005-10-06|2013-01-08|2017-08-17|2018-11-07|2019-01-25|2009-04-22|2007-08-23|2006-03-27|2015-01-01|2016-06-10|2016-11-15|2018-03-23|2015-06-04|2005-11-23|2016-07-11|2011-04-13|2016-11-03|2009-06-18|2012-06-29|2006-03-08|2015-07-17|2012-04-19|2013-12-15|2019-09-03|2017-03-08|2010-11-04|2002-03-12|2019-10-02|2017-12-13|2006-05-04|2006-03-01|2019-01-14|2005-11-22|2000-11-21|2005-10-20|2012-01-01|2013-10-31|2019-11-10|2019-08-08|2009-02-06|2015-11-12|2006-01-05|2005-08-04|2000-11-24,Canada|EU|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,non-nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,,Glimepiride,A10BB12,2,mg,,

Ivabradine, brand name Corlanor, was approved by the FDA in April 2015 for the treatment of chronic heart failure in patients with an ejection fraction of ≤35%, in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥70 beats per minute, who are not on beta-blockers due to contraindications or already receiving maximum beta-blocker dose. Recently a new indication was added to treat symptomatic heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy for patients 6 months or more in age[Label]. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the ""funny"" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Although non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers also effectively lower heart rate, they exhibit adverse events due to their negative ionotropic effects. Therefore, as ivabradine is designed as a ""pure"" heart rate-lowering drug by selectively acting on the If channels, it may offer a more favorable side effect profile due to its lower likelihood of causing serious adverse effects.",468.594,COC1=C(OC)C=C2[C@@H](CN(C)CCCN3CCC4=CC(OC)=C(OC)C=C4CC3=O)CC2=C1,,3H48L0LPZQ,TP19837BZK,Ivabradine Accord|Procoralan|Ivabradine Zentiva|Ivabradine Jensonr|Corlanor|Ivabradine Anpharm|Lancora|Corlentor,2020-12-16|2019-04-19|2021-02-11|2017-03-17|2016-09-08|2021-12-24|2015-04-20,Canada|EU|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,non-nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,,Ivabradine,C01EB17,10,mg,,

On a weight basis, methimazole is 10 times more potent than the other major antithyroid thionamide used in North America, [propylthiouracil],[L8339] and is the active metabolite of the pro-drug [carbimazole], which is an antithyroid medication used in the United Kingdom and parts of the former British Commonwealth.[A184733] Traditionally, methimazole has been preferentially used over propylthiouracil due to the risk of fulminant hepatotoxicity carried by the latter,[A184757] with propylthiouracil being preferred in pregnancy due to a perceived lower risk of teratogenic effects. Despite documented teratogenic effects in its published labels,[L8336,L8339] the true teratogenicity of methimazole appears to be unclear[A184643,A184757,A184763] and its place in therapy may change in the future.",114.169,CN1C=CNC1=S,,554Z48XN5E,,Tapazole|Apo-methimazole|PMS-methimazole|PHL-methimazole|Jamp Methimazole|Dom-methimazole|Methimazole Tablets USP|Mar-methimazole|Methimazole,2020-03-19|2010-07-07|2001-03-27|2010-03-02|2012-07-23|2012-03-07|2007-12-14|2014-02-27|2016-07-01|2013-01-01|2000-03-29|2018-10-19|2007-12-20|2006-04-19|2018-10-06|2015-10-06|2020-02-12|2022-03-14|2008-01-07|2018-08-28|2022-08-08|2009-10-13|2011-11-01|2010-03-03|2012-01-15|2022-02-28|2000-03-31|2012-01-12|2014-01-01|1951-12-31|2018-09-13|2015-11-12|2012-02-28|2020-08-21|2005-03-18|2018-10-08|2021-08-21|2004-08-13|2013-03-20|2013-07-02|2012-01-16|2015-09-28|2022-08-20|2004-11-05,Canada|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,non-nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,,thiamazole,H03BB02,10,mg,,Methimazole

Having been developed in the 1980s by GlaxoSmithKline and approved by the US FDA since January 1991, ondansetron has demonstrated a long history of use and efficacy. Commonly formulated as oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), and injections, and available as generic products as well, ondansetron continues to see contemporary innovations in its formulation and use, including the development of orally soluble films that are both discreet in administration and less of a burden in comparison to having patients attempt to swallow pills during emesis.[L5221]

As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. 

More specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. It's important to note that Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. Although all six of these compounds should technically be referred to as vitamin B6, the term vitamin B6 is commonly used interchangeably with just one of them, pyridoxine [A32836]. 

Vitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [A32837]. 

Pyridoxine is used medically for the treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency and for the prophylaxis of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy (due to [DB00951]'s mechanism of action which competitively inhibits the action of pyridoxine in the above-mentioned metabolic functions). It is also used in combination with [DB00366] (as the commercially available product Diclectin) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.",169.1778,CC1=C(O)C(CO)=C(CO)C=N1,-0.77,KV2JZ1BI6Z,68Y4CF58BV,"Flintstones W Extra C Tab|L-Methyl MC|Multitam|Energy Booster Essence|Lgb-dtx Tab 10mg|Replavite|E.V.C.

However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]",473.583,OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C1=C(C(=O)C2=CC=C(OCCN3CCCCC3)C=C2)C2=C(S1)C=C(O)C=C2,5.2,YX9162EO3I,4F86W47BR6,Act Raloxifene|PMS-raloxifene|Evista|Raloxifene Teva|Optruma|Raloxifene Hydrochloride|Raloxifene|Raloxifene hydrochloride|Teva-raloxifene|Apo-raloxifene|Evista (60mg),2006-04-17|2015-03-01|2016-07-08|2016-09-08|2011-09-19|2014-11-13|1998-01-06|2012-03-07|2016-03-22|2016-06-29|1998-11-20|2018-06-27|2021-03-11|2016-07-21|2014-11-03|2014-09-24|2013-11-28|2012-06-19|2015-06-18|2016-05-09|2021-01-17|2014-05-29|2000-05-11|2020-12-17|2016-11-09|2014-03-01|2016-01-20|2009-03-31|2017-12-30|2009-07-28|2014-11-12|2015-08-28|2016-10-12|2014-03-28,Canada|EU|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,non-nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,,Raloxifene,G03XC01,60,mg,,

It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Simvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181427]",418.5662,[H][C@]12[C@H](C[C@@H](C)C=C1C=C[C@H](C)[C@@H]2CC[C@@H]1C[C@@H](O)CC(=O)O1)OC(=O)C(C)(C)CC,4.68,AGG2FN16EV,,Auro-simvastatin|Jamp-simvastatin|Zocor|Septa-simvastatin|Bio-simvastatin|Mar-simvastatin|Q-simvastatin|Riva-simvastatin|Mint-simvastatin|Mylan-simvastatin|Dom-simvastatin|Ava-simvastatin|Cholib|Pharma-simvastatin|Simvastatin Tablets 40mg|Simvastatin Tablets|Priva-simvastatin|Ratio-simvastatin|Bci Simvastatin|Taro-simvastatin|Simvastatin-5|Juvisync|Simcor|Simvastatin-20|Act Simvastatin|Simvastatin|Simvastatin Tablets 20mg|Ag-simvastatin|Simvastatin Tablets 10mg|Simvastatin Tablets 5mg|Simvastatin-80|Ntp-simvastatin|Zym-simvastatin|Simvastatin-10|Teva-simvastatin|Sandoz Simvastatin|Simvastatin-odan|FloLipid|Nu-simvastatin Tablets|PMS-simvastatin|Simvastatin Tablets 80mg|Ezetimibe and Simvastatin|Ipg-simvastatin|Simvastatin-40|Vytorin|PHL-simvastatin|Apo-simvastatin,2019-08-15|1996-08-14|2009-11-05|2011-06-13|2019-03-13|2010-06-11|2011-08-08|2014-12-03|2017-04-06|2013-02-01|2013-06-13|2021-01-18|2016-09-28|2011-10-14|2008-02-15|2009-07-20|2010-06-09|2013-09-19|2008-05-05|2010-06-17|2014-12-09|2008-06-05|2010-03-26|2015-12-17|2005-08-10|2006-11-15|2010-04-21|2015-02-27|2017-06-01|2017-11-21|2010-11-28|2016-03-30|2011-01-20|2003-10-29|1999-07-21|2011-02-16|2022-05-26|2003-03-10|2015-03-26|2010-08-25|2017-11-01|2007-02-02|2010-03-23|2011-01-24|2016-12-13|2006-07-10|2015-03-17|2018-09-24|2013-02-19|2020-05-01|2004-06-21|2004-11-19|1990-12-31|2016-09-08|2005-11-03|2004-05-07|2008-01-23|2006-06-27|2011-01-27|2019-08-19|2020-01-16|2018-09-06|2009-07-14|2013-09-01|2009-06-15|2012-02-14|2009-11-09|2016-06-08|1991-12-31|2011-04-10|2009-09-24|2009-10-22|2010-03-12|2008-02-01|2017-04-26|2008-07-21|2007-06-01|2016-01-05|2013-03-07|2014-07-03|2010-11-27|2013-04-04|2015-03-23|2004-06-23|2011-09-07|2014-09-12|2010-09-14|2003-09-03|2011-10-03|2012-03-23|2014-11-01|2019-06-27|2018-01-12|2016-01-15|2009-02-26|2008-03-31|2011-08-02|2012-06-11|2012-09-18|1994-12-31|2019-12-28|2015-08-12|2011-05-02|2011-10-17|2013-01-01|2011-11-22|2007-05-23|2019-01-04|2019-05-30|2019-02-05|2021-06-01|2010-08-06|1991-12-23|2018-09-18|2018-04-05|2010-08-27|2017-11-29|2011-07-21|2012-12-18|2012-01-04|2006-06-23|2011-01-13|2012-02-28|2016-12-14|2014-10-21|2005-04-04|2017-08-18|2013-03-01|2011-10-07|2007-06-12|2010-09-21|2011-08-17|2011-09-08|2018-11-20|2003-04-10|2014-11-27|2007-08-13|2010-11-22|2019-02-08|2014-12-02|2010-09-27|2007-06-14|2012-06-14|2011-04-14|2009-07-01|2014-09-30|2004-03-22|2003-01-15|2004-07-23|2013-07-08|2008-06-24|2012-06-12|2019-09-19|2014-04-21|2012-01-09|2006-12-20|2012-11-22|2008-02-26|2013-09-02|2012-02-03|2022-01-31|2007-08-16|2011-10-11|2012-03-29|2013-05-14|2022-10-04|2012-12-20|2011-02-11|2015-11-23|2014-01-01|2016-02-19|2003-09-26|2021-09-08|2011-09-26|2017-12-24|2005-03-14|2015-12-02|2011-03-01|2011-01-15|2004-08-11|2008-07-08|2006-08-02|2014-02-10|2006-07-21|2018-07-03|2010-06-22|2003-10-27|2010-10-01|2002-12-20,Canada|EU|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/f2f67ab8-49a1-23df-e053-2a95a90a4050/spl-doc?hl=Simvastatin ,Simvastatin,C10AA01,30,mg,,

It is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Thiamine decomposes if heated. Thiamine was first discovered by Umetaro Suzuki in Japan when researching how rice bran cured patients of Beriberi. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine plays an important role in helping the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. It is essential for normal growth and development and helps to maintain proper functioning of the heart and the nervous and digestive systems. Thiamine cannot be stored in the body; however, once absorbed, the vitamin is concentrated in muscle tissue.",265.355,CC1=C(CCO)SC=[N+]1CC1=CN=C(C)N=C1N,,4ABT0J945J,X66NSO3N35,"Flintstones W Extra C Tab|Amladex|Multitam|Replavite|Thiamine Hydrochloride Inj 100mg/ml|Vitamines Et Mineraux|Revitex Ampoules Et Comprimes|One-A-day Advance Fem - Tablets|Vitachrom Gc|Vitafol Ultra|Prenatvite Complete|Thiamine Hydrochloride Inj 100mg/ml USP|Hemarexin Amp|Multiple Vitamins|Vitaday Tab|Synergistic Manganese Cap|Folica-V|Complexe B-75|Childrens Chewable Multivitamins W Iron|Reno Caps|Pre-Tabs DHA Prenatal Multi-vitamin/Mineral Supplement with DHA/EPA|Se-Natal One|Gesticare DHA|Central-vite 18 Essential|Neo Vites Tab|Tricare Prenatal Compleat|Super Pantoplex|Vit-HA Multi Vitamin and Zinc Supplement|Vitamin B Complex + C 600mg Tab|WesTab Plus|Select-OB Plus DHA Prenatal Supplement Plus DHA|Moms Choice Rx|Children Choice Multivitamin W Iron Chew Tab|Stressmates|Vena-Bal DHA|Folika-V|M.V.I.

It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver. Tolbutamide and its metabolites are excreted in urine (75-85%) and feces.",270.348,CCCCNC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C)C=C1,2.34,982XCM1FOI,E830VC49W5,Mobenol Tablets 500mg|Tolbutamide|Orinase 0.5gm|Tolbutamide Tab 500mg|Novo-butamide 500mg|Orinase 1gm,1989-11-01|1966-12-31|1957-12-31|1962-12-31|1978-12-31|1968-12-31|1979-05-01|1975-12-31,Canada|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,non-nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,"https://www.drugs.com/monograph/tolbutamide.html

More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits.[L5744]

In order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body's ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.

There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including [DB00564] (CBZ), [DB00252] (PHT), or barbiturates.[A37004] Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. 

Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.",441.3975,NC1=NC(=O)C2=NC(CNC3=CC=C(C=C3)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O)=CN=C2N1,-2.5,935E97BOY8,9P9W8GGU78,"Flintstones W Extra C Tab|Amladex|Multitam|Replavite|One-A-day Advance Fem - Tablets|Vitachrom Gc|NephPlex Rx|Vitafol Ultra|Prenatvite Complete|Multiple Vitamins|PRENATE Enhance|Folica-V|Complexe B-75|Nioxin Recharging Complex|Reno Caps|Taron-prex Prenatal|NuFera|Pre-Tabs DHA Prenatal Multi-vitamin/Mineral Supplement with DHA/EPA|Se-Natal One|Gesticare DHA|Central-vite 18 Essential|Tricare Prenatal Compleat|Vit-HA Multi Vitamin and Zinc Supplement|Super Pantoplex|WesTab Plus|Folcaps Omega-3|Nexa Select Rx Prenatal Vitamin with Plant-Based DHA|Folika-D|Moms Choice Rx|Select-OB Plus DHA Prenatal Supplement Plus DHA|TL-Icon|Virt-PN Plus|NovaFerrum|Stressmates|Vena-Bal DHA|PreferaOB ONE|Virt-Select PRENATAL/POSTNATAL|Folic Acid|Folic Acid-b12 Tab|Folika-V|M.V.I.

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.",232.2783,COC1=CC2=C(NC=C2CCNC(C)=O)C=C1,1.6,JL5DK93RCL,,Safrel Melatonin|Slenyto|Amerix Melatonin|Hypnosom|Medi-doze Sleep Aid|Melatonin|Circadin|Melatonin Rapid Release Gelcaps 5 mg|Melatonin Rapid Release Gelcaps 10 mg|Medi-doze Rx Sleep Aid,2013-02-20|2017-08-01|2017-01-01|2020-08-30|2016-09-08|2017-08-16|2019-12-05|2018-06-26|2021-02-10,EU|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,,Non-Nephrotoxic,"https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01065

It is used in the treatment of both epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is the first medication since lithium granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type I. It is approved for use in more than 30 countries.[A191350]

Lamotrigine has relatively few side-effects and does not require laboratory monitoring.

Chlorthalidone improves blood pressure and swelling by preventing water absorption from the kidneys through inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter in the distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure.[A176324]

Chlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension.[A173863] In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that chlorthalidone had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to [DB00722], [DB00381], or [DB00590].[A173884, A173887] Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs.

Chlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as [DB00999]. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.[A176330]",338.766,NS(=O)(=O)C1=C(Cl)C=CC(=C1)C1(O)NC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C12,0.85,Q0MQD1073Q,,Chlorthalidone Chlorthalidone|Chlorthalidone 100mg Tablets|Novo-thalidone Tab 50mg|Chlorthalidone Tab 100mg|Aa-atenidone|Tenoretic 50/25mg Tab|Chlorthalidone 50mg Tablets|Combipres 0.1/15 Tab|Uridon Tab 50mg|Teva-atenolol/chlorthalidone|Tenoretic|Hygroton 50mg|Apo Chlorthalidone Tab 100mg|Uridon Tab 100mg|Tenoretic 100/25mg Tab|Ntp-atenolol/chlorthalidone|Chlorthalidone Tab 50mg|Jamp Chlorthalidone|Thalitone|Edarbyclor|Novo-thalidone Tab 100mg|Clorpres|Chlorthalidone|Atenolol and Chlorthalidone,2019-06-24|2005-04-15|2021-10-25|1981-02-26|2022-08-05|2022-05-10|2019-05-15|2013-02-01|2004-08-12|2019-07-01|2017-05-01|2013-03-21|2019-03-26|2008-10-13|2005-05-05|2015-04-21|1975-12-31|2020-11-25|2018-08-15|2016-12-12|1990-09-30|2016-05-16|2016-02-12|1976-12-31|2020-02-13|2013-05-09|1974-12-31|1998-06-12|2003-06-09|2018-10-22|2022-11-29|2021-05-20|2015-11-01|2022-10-06|2022-03-23|2018-11-21|2020-02-25|2011-12-23|1990-09-01|2019-07-12|2009-06-08|2018-04-04|2017-05-17|2021-12-27|1995-05-02|1994-12-31|2022-10-03|1992-08-01|2019-11-21|2013-02-22|2022-10-20|2017-08-10|2009-11-18|2019-11-22|1993-04-29|1993-10-31|2019-02-26|2019-03-12|2019-04-29|1970-12-31|2019-11-27|2019-11-12|2022-03-01|2013-03-28|2011-05-19|2007-12-12|2021-03-31|1995-12-31|1999-03-16|1978-12-31|2020-04-14|1968-12-31|2005-01-26|2019-08-06|2020-01-22|2018-10-23|2019-12-13|1988-12-20|2022-08-29|2018-05-28|1998-03-13|2011-06-15|2017-09-19|2019-05-09,Canada|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/583992c2-b789-4267-9a8f-c1ee5db3f29f/spl-doc  ,Chlortalidone,C03BA04,25,mg,,Chlorthalidone

The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects.[A203501] Attempts at overcoming these limitations first saw the development of O-glucoside analogs of phlorizin (e.g. [remogliflozin etabonate]), but these molecules proved relatively pharmacokinetically unstable. The development of C-glucoside phlorizin analogs remedied the issues observed in the previous generation, and led to the FDA approval of [canagliflozin] in 2013 and both [dapagliflozin] and empagliflozin in 2014.[A203501] As the most recently approved of the ""flozin"" drugs, empagliflozin carries the highest selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (approximately 2700-fold). Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]",450.91,OC[C@H]1O[C@H]([C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O)C1=CC=C(Cl)C(CC2=CC=C(O[C@H]3CCOC3)C=C2)=C1,,HDC1R2M35U,,Jardiance|Synjardy|Synjardy XR|Glyxambi|Trijardy XR,2020-12-16|2015-08-11|2014-08-01|2019-04-29|2015-08-26|2019-11-22|2016-12-21|2016-09-08|2016-12-10|2015-01-30|2019-03-27|2016-08-03|2020-04-23,Canada|EU|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/5777b8a8-ada6-4950-8548-43a1de11f075/spl-doc?hl=Empagliflozin ,Empagliflozin,A10BK03,17.5,mg,,

Occurring commonly in blind individuals without light perception, this condition is often characterized by periods of night-time insomnia and day-time sleepiness. In blind individuals, a lack of light stimulation causes an extension of the 24-hour circadian cycle and can lead to progressively delayed sleep onset. By activating melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, tasimelteon has been shown to improve sleep by resynchronizing the circadian rhythm through its ""non-photic"" mechanism.

Sir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize.[A178429] Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. Atenolol itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name Tenormin and received FDA approval in September, 1981.[label]

Despite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension.[A235850,A235855] A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality.[A235850,A235855] Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses.[A235860,A235865] A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient.[A235865] The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.[A235850,A235855,A235860,A235865]",266.3361,CC(C)NCC(O)COC1=CC=C(CC(N)=O)C=C1,0.16,50VV3VW0TI,,"Atenolol|Dom-atenolol - 50mg|Mint-atenol|Nu-atenol Tab 50mg|PMS-atenolol|Atenolol Tablets 100mg|Dom-atenolol - 100mg|Med Atenolol - Tab 50mg|Nu-atenol Tab 100mg|Atenolol - Tab 100mg|Ipg-atenolol|Ag-atenolol|Orb-atenolol|Aa-atenidone|Ava-atenolol|Atenolol Tablets 50mg|Tenoretic 50/25mg Tab|Act Atenolol|Ftp-atenolol|Apo-atenol Tab 100mg|Septa-atenolol|Riva-atenolol 50 mg|Teva-atenolol/chlorthalidone|Taro-atenolol|Med Atenolol - Tab 100mg|Riva-atenolol|Tenoretic|Sandoz Atenolol|Mar-atenolol|Teva-atenolol|Bci Atenolol|Mylan-atenolol|Jamp-atenolol|Atenolol - Tab 50mg|Atenolol Scopolamine|Atenolol Tablets, BP|Tenoretic 100/25mg Tab|Ntp-atenolol/chlorthalidone|Taro-atenolol Tab 50mg|Apo-atenol Tab 50mg|Taro-atenolol Tab 100mg|Ntp-atenol|Penta-atenolol - 100mg|Penta-atenolol - 50mg|Riva-atenolol 100 mg|Atenolol and Chlorthalidone|Tenormin|Bio-atenolol",2019-10-30|2019-06-24|2014-10-01|2011-06-13|2010-10-15|2021-10-25|2011-04-08|2005-07-05|2022-11-22|1999-03-04|2021-02-02|2003-04-21|2014-01-06|2015-04-28|2019-05-17|2018-07-26|2004-08-12|2005-10-08|2018-01-22|2013-07-10|2022-01-25|2014-10-09|2019-03-20|2017-08-11|1995-02-22|2013-09-03|2010-03-03|2020-02-04|2017-05-18|1996-12-30|2013-02-06|2004-08-01|2019-11-06|2019-03-26|2016-08-02|2017-11-10|2019-11-01|2004-08-13|1997-07-24|2015-03-20|1992-05-01|2020-11-10|2022-12-19|2017-10-20|2011-01-20|2004-12-01|2018-01-04|2015-03-26|2005-05-05|2015-04-21|2016-06-20|2022-09-21|2020-11-25|2011-01-30|2000-05-23|2020-09-02|2013-06-17|2018-01-02|1999-06-16|1990-12-31|2016-05-16|2013-11-15|2019-10-04|1999-06-17|2013-05-09|2018-06-27|2009-06-15|2017-04-04|2019-08-14|2018-03-19|2015-10-29|2015-12-08|2011-06-09|1991-12-31|2018-10-22|2016-08-17|2010-10-21|2010-05-24|2015-08-20|2017-12-15|2013-02-15|1997-07-23|1993-12-31|2015-11-01|2022-10-06|2012-08-22|2014-06-24|2019-09-17|2007-12-04|2014-02-20|2020-03-12|2021-03-03|2011-06-20|1990-09-01|2018-07-18|2017-07-19|2014-11-01|2016-08-22|1988-12-31|2012-12-11|2006-07-12|1995-05-02|2019-01-10|2013-03-26|1994-12-31|1989-12-31|2011-03-16|2020-02-07|1999-03-09|1992-08-01|2019-11-21|2010-04-07|2017-01-31|2002-11-28|2013-02-22|2011-08-10|2007-07-10|2012-04-30|2004-11-01|2012-04-18|2011-09-15|1995-07-19|2020-11-11|1992-01-24|2009-09-23|1998-03-31|2007-12-13|2015-07-01|2019-11-22|1996-10-17|2015-10-15|1993-04-29|1993-10-31|2009-11-10|2012-10-22|2019-03-12|2018-01-01|2019-04-29|2011-06-06|1996-09-05|1993-03-30|2020-12-02|2021-03-25|2011-04-25|2015-04-15|1995-02-17|1991-09-17|2021-03-08|1999-09-03|2013-03-28|2022-03-01|1997-07-30|1991-12-27|2011-04-22|2017-11-30|2007-03-02|2007-12-12|2018-02-02|2009-12-04|2009-07-01|2012-01-19|2011-01-12|2010-06-10|1995-12-31|2016-11-30|2012-01-18|2017-03-31|2019-01-14|2017-01-19|2017-06-23|2019-12-12|2011-07-07|2012-10-30|1995-04-24|2019-07-29|2015-12-10|1991-02-01|2010-06-23|2014-01-01|2017-03-22|1999-04-26|1999-06-15|2013-02-18|2018-03-01|2005-11-17|2000-06-07|1996-07-30|1998-10-09|2007-10-31|2005-07-04|2020-10-20|2018-05-31|2010-01-07|2004-11-16,Canada|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,https://fdalabel.fda.gov:8443/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/f419c72e-f1f9-4b5a-94ff-a525367cdce4/spl-doc?hl=Atenolol ,Atenolol,C07AB03,75,mg,,

[Paliperidone], another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone).[L12885]

Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.[L12885]

Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.[L12885]",410.4845,CC1=C(CCN2CCC(CC2)C2=NOC3=C2C=CC(F)=C3)C(=O)N2CCCCC2=N1,,L6UH7ZF8HC,0S6B72E3LK,Risperidone - 0.25|Ratio-risperidone|Mylan-risperidone ODT|Risperdal M-tab|Truemed Group LLC|Risperidone - 2|Risperidone - 1|Apo-risperidone|Dom-risperidone ODT|Risperidone|Mylan-risperidone|PHL-risperidone ODT|Pro-risperidone|Nu-risperidone|Ava-risperidone|Ag-risperidone|Mar-risperidone|Risperidone - 3|Ran-risperidone|Q-risperidone|Risperidone Tablets|Mint-risperidon|Act Risperidone|Dom-risperidone|Risperidone M-TAB|Risperidone - 0.5|Risperidone - 4|Taro-risperidone|Risperdal Oral Solution|PMS-risperidone ODT|Risperdal Consta|PMS-risperidone|Risperdal|Okedi|Perseris|Riva-risperidone|Sandoz Risperidone|Teva-risperidone|Ipg-risperidone|Jamp-risperidone|PHL-risperidone,2012-09-19|2017-03-27|2018-10-29|2011-12-16|2011-04-08|2006-08-09|2018-08-06|2007-12-21|2021-05-26|2014-01-29|2010-06-29|2007-12-14|2018-01-22|2013-05-07|2011-10-13|1999-09-17|2016-09-15|2019-03-25|2009-06-01|2015-04-06|2006-06-30|2010-08-13|2013-03-11|2019-01-01|1993-12-29|2005-06-20|2003-10-29|2019-06-05|2022-09-17|2015-03-26|2010-08-25|2007-03-13|2008-11-24|2021-06-15|2004-09-08|2012-07-23|2015-06-01|2019-01-02|2013-04-17|2021-09-22|2006-07-05|2012-01-03|2022-05-04|2012-03-19|2018-09-06|2009-06-15|2003-10-23|2018-10-22|2008-09-22|2014-06-01|2010-10-21|2019-05-22|2010-01-13|2009-10-22|2008-11-12|1993-12-31|2011-09-22|2015-03-13|2015-01-30|2009-12-24|2011-07-28|2009-06-10|2018-10-08|2008-07-23|2006-08-08|1999-05-28|1997-01-10|2014-11-01|2019-06-27|2009-02-26|2009-10-25|2012-04-25|2008-10-09|2007-10-24|2008-10-21|2010-08-30|2013-05-01|2018-11-05|2006-07-31|2021-01-26|2016-05-19|2008-07-09|2011-01-05|2009-10-26|2013-08-28|2013-01-01|2010-04-07|2021-08-01|2013-04-13|2009-10-06|2008-12-29|2009-11-16|2008-11-13|2010-08-06|2013-05-06|2018-10-31|2007-03-08|2008-06-30|2015-03-12|2020-12-15|2009-10-24|2008-10-06|2010-12-03|2013-11-30|2010-12-06|2011-06-10|2021-05-06|2010-01-12|2009-07-29|2009-12-22|2008-10-08|2014-03-10|2011-04-11|2012-10-22|2013-03-18|2010-11-12|2018-07-02|2011-11-04|2014-08-27|2012-02-13|2015-09-09|2007-07-24|2015-04-24|2022-07-27|2007-10-29|2011-08-18|2009-07-01|2011-05-31|1998-03-04|2018-05-01|2010-06-08|2018-11-09|2008-12-02|2013-06-18|2014-04-23|2010-12-23|2015-01-12|2017-01-19|2010-11-15|1996-06-10|2009-01-01|2009-10-28|2014-01-10|2013-10-24|2018-08-22|2003-10-02|2011-05-11|2015-12-24|2011-10-11|2014-01-01|2008-09-17|2010-02-16|2008-12-05|2009-11-30|2012-11-14|2009-02-24|2003-04-02|2009-10-14|2003-07-27|2015-04-14|2011-02-07|2011-03-28|2014-03-28|2008-10-24,Canada|EU|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/523d4f99-1d6f-413f-9d6e-2ca430aaac14/spl-doc ,Risperidone,N05AX08,5,mg,,

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]",383.37,COC1=C(OC)C(CS(=O)C2=NC3=C(N2)C=C(OC(F)F)C=C3)=NC=C1,2.05,D8TST4O562,1AL13B11R4,Mint-pantoprazole|Mylan-pantoprazole T|Jamp-pantoprazole|M-pantoprazole|Pantoprazole Magnesium|Rbx-pantoprazole|Ran-pantoprazole|Pantoprazole Sodium DR|Act Pantoprazole|Protonix Delayed-release|Ratio-pantoprazole|PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM Delayed Release|Pantoloc Control|Protonix|Pantoprazole Sodium for Injection|Protonix I.V.|Abbott-pantoprazole|Bio-pantoprazole|Somac Control|Ag-pantoprazole Sodium|Taro-pantoprazole|Panto IV|Pantozol Control|Mylan-pantoprazole|Pantoprazole Sodium D/r|Pantoprazole for Injection|Pantoprazole Sodium|Pantoprazole Sodium Dr|Ava-pantoprazole|Dom-pantoprazole|Q-pantoprazole|Pantoprazole-20|Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Delayed-Release|Panto-byk|Protonix Delayed-Release|Auro-pantoprazole|Nra-pantoprazole|Ag-pantoprazole|Mar-pantoprazole|Pantoprazole sodium|Teva-pantoprazole Magnesium|Pantoprazole-40|Pantoprazole|Van-pantoprazole|Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release|Pantoprazole Tablets|Riva-pantoprazole|Tecta|PMS-pantoprazole|Jamp Pantoprazole Sodium|Pantoprazole T|Teva-pantoprazole|Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed Release|Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release|Ntp-pantoprazole|Controloc Control|Pantecta Control|Ipg-pantoprazole|Pantoloc|Sandoz Pantoprazole|Apo-pantoprazole|PHL-pantoprazole,2016-09-07|2011-02-08|2014-09-10|2021-03-18|2013-08-22|2014-03-05|2018-06-19|2007-12-21|2021-02-02|2019-12-18|2009-06-03|2007-09-10|2020-06-12|2018-10-06|2014-05-23|2017-02-21|2018-07-17|2014-07-21|2018-12-27|2017-12-19|2015-09-21|2009-01-29|2018-12-06|2021-01-28|2010-12-14|2015-11-25|2011-01-19|2015-02-19|2022-05-19|2011-09-13|2011-12-01|2013-08-08|2022-06-06|2013-01-10|2017-07-01|2017-11-16|2019-09-13|2015-03-20|2017-10-20|2011-01-20|2016-03-30|2016-02-06|2008-01-31|2017-11-20|2017-11-01|2014-12-12|2014-12-15|2016-06-20|2012-10-25|2000-05-01|2008-04-11|2017-10-25|2021-08-27|2019-03-11|2018-02-27|2014-12-01|2018-01-02|2015-06-01|2012-02-17|2016-11-24|2016-09-08|2015-03-18|2019-10-21|2014-03-21|2019-10-15|2017-04-04|2022-02-21|2022-05-01|2015-08-31|2011-02-23|2011-11-17|2019-08-29|1997-03-05|2011-11-15|2010-02-26|2008-01-02|2012-06-10|2014-06-12|2008-10-27|2008-02-12|2022-05-18|2020-08-18|2019-09-17|2019-05-01|2012-09-28|2014-01-16|2022-06-22|2019-09-01|2022-07-15|2015-05-01|2014-07-30|2013-08-25|2007-04-03|2017-03-06|2003-05-02|2022-01-21|2018-01-17|2020-03-20|2008-06-03|2014-07-16|2011-10-03|2009-02-26|2014-11-01|2017-09-22|2022-04-06|2011-09-01|2020-03-04|2019-12-30|2019-04-04|2013-05-01|2013-08-26|2022-09-09|2019-12-17|2020-11-15|2014-07-18|2022-06-01|2015-10-30|2014-10-16|2014-02-17|2013-04-10|2001-08-28|2015-01-13|2007-12-19|2014-02-11|2021-12-01|2022-03-25|2008-06-04|2016-02-22|2000-05-02|2015-01-01|2020-03-30|2008-03-11|2001-05-01|2018-07-12|2019-03-08|2019-01-11|2012-11-08|2022-05-25|2013-05-24|2013-04-02|2022-08-25|2009-08-28|2015-12-21|2013-11-18|2015-05-20|2010-04-26|2022-03-01|2012-05-02|2015-02-24|2014-02-06|2011-11-14|2022-10-31|2006-03-15|2022-07-27|2008-02-29|2011-09-19|2013-02-08|2014-09-30|2008-03-05|2015-09-04|2017-08-21|2018-07-25|2017-02-15|2016-11-30|2020-07-01|2013-01-15|2017-09-21|2013-01-23|2014-11-19|2015-12-10|2010-05-17|2014-04-24|2014-01-01|2015-11-16|2016-10-18|2022-08-29|1999-04-06|2010-10-12|2021-11-26|2012-03-01|2012-01-23|2018-05-04|2014-02-18|2011-02-07|2014-03-17|2020-04-20,Canada|EU|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/eeb5f3b4-5e6e-8bec-e053-2995a90a6457/spl-doc#_3bb8f037-c98d-ee0b-0233-07ec3bcad24f  ,Pantoprazole,A02BC02,40,mg,,

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Lovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]",404.5396,[H][C@]12[C@H](C[C@@H](C)C=C1C=C[C@H](C)[C@@H]2CC[C@@H]1C[C@@H](O)CC(=O)O1)OC(=O)[C@@H](C)CC,4.08,9LHU78OQFD,,Act Lovastatin|Lovastatin-20|Mevacor|Nu-lovastatin Tablets|Teva-lovastatin|Sandoz Lovastatin|Lovastatin-40|Lovastatin|Pro-lovastatin|Dom-lovastatin|Mylan-lovastatin|Ava-lovastatin|Ran-lovastatin|Ratio-lovastatin|PHL-lovastatin|Altoprev|Riva-lovastatin|Advicor|PMS-lovastatin,2005-07-05|2003-01-07|2007-02-28|2006-11-24|2014-02-21|2016-05-01|2016-03-03|2022-08-08|2017-04-07|2007-05-15|2019-07-26|2010-12-14|2001-02-08|2003-04-14|2004-12-17|2007-11-01|2001-12-17|2017-01-10|2011-03-09|2019-08-21|2017-01-23|2008-03-27|2006-04-14|2013-01-03|2010-07-26|1990-12-31|2002-06-26|2011-03-11|2013-04-09|2007-02-20|2007-08-06|2020-05-28|2003-06-03|2002-05-22|2012-09-11|2010-04-10|2022-11-17|2003-02-25|2013-02-15|2015-11-01|2019-04-11|2017-02-02|2002-01-15|2012-04-03|2014-06-24|2018-01-05|2005-12-01|2014-11-04|2006-08-08|2016-11-02|2013-09-27|2013-10-09|2018-07-09|2020-02-06|2004-02-18|1988-12-31|2001-02-19|2002-07-12|2010-03-22|2008-03-14|2010-04-03|2008-07-09|2013-07-29|2009-02-18|2010-04-07|2018-03-14|2002-07-16|2011-03-03|2005-10-27|2011-11-01|2005-07-11|2020-05-05|2009-07-13|2017-08-07|2017-02-08|2003-01-20|1987-08-31|2019-11-18|2004-06-07|2011-02-22|2018-07-10|2013-03-18|2014-01-30|2003-08-15|2020-04-07|2004-07-28|2015-05-20|2017-06-07|2021-04-02|1997-03-27|2017-10-02|2011-07-18|2002-06-06|2011-08-18|2002-01-28|2012-01-31|2010-10-06|2005-11-09|2005-12-07|2017-08-21|2014-04-29|2001-12-21|2014-04-21|2002-11-25|2014-03-11|2013-07-11|2006-01-25|2013-10-31|2011-10-26|2012-01-06|2011-02-11|2014-01-01|2021-01-25|2003-02-27|2011-09-23|2011-06-17|2014-02-10|2017-06-06|2010-06-22|2010-04-08,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/aa6c8a42-c629-b871-e053-2a95a90a5c5f/spl-doc?hl=lovastatin#s18 ,Lovastatin,C10AA02,45,mg,,

Etraverine is used clinically for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. On January 18, 2007, the FDA granted accelerated approved for the use of etravirine 100mg tablets in the treatment of adult HIV-1 infection documented to be resistant to therapy with other NNRTIs and antiretroviral agents. On March 26, 2012, approval was extended for use in treatment-experienced pediatric patients 6 to 18 years of age, weighing at least 16 kg. Etravarine must always be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. 

Etravirine exerts its effects via direct inhibition of the reverse transcriptase enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and consequently blocks DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent polymerase activity. Etravirine does not inhibit human DNA polymerase alpha, beta or gamma. 

Common side effects of use include mild to moderate rash within the first 6 weeks of therapy, nausea, diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy. Patients are advised to immediately contact their healthcare provider if a rash develops. 

In 2009, postmarketing case reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and other hypersensitivity reactions lead to a revision of etravirine's ""Warnings and Precautions,"" as well as notification of health care providers. 

In 2013, reports of Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) in the setting of immune reconstitution, as well as more in depth information about the development of rashes in patients taking etravirine, lead to a modification of etravirine's monograph.",435.277,CC1=CC(=CC(C)=C1OC1=C(Br)C(N)=NC(NC2=CC=C(C=C2)C#N)=N1)C#N,,0C50HW4FO1,,Etravirine|Intelence,2013-06-14|2013-03-18|2008-01-18|2010-12-22|2008-03-27|2011-12-12|2022-10-04|2012-03-26|2008-02-21|2021-06-14|2022-06-07|2016-09-08|2012-10-10|2009-07-01|2022-06-05,Canada|EU|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/6a9cbc29-9f15-4b24-8d86-206b82887f3d/spl-doc ,Etravirine,J05AG04,0.4,g,,

Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]

Bupropion was originally classified as an ""atypical"" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]

When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).[A178816]

Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.[A178789] Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.[F4624]

When used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.[L6562] Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.[L6562,A179038,A179050] The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo.[A179047]",239.741,CC(NC(C)(C)C)C(=O)C1=CC(Cl)=CC=C1,3.6,01ZG3TPX31,E70G3G5863,Odan Bupropion SR|Naltrexone Hydrochloride and

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]",481.538,CC(C)C1=NC(=NC(C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)=C1\C=C\[C@@H](O)C[C@@H](O)CC(=O)O)N(C)S(C)(=O)=O,0.13,413KH5ZJ73,83MVU38M7Q,Rosuvastatin Calcium|Sandoz Rosuvastatin|Rosuvastatin calcium|Ntp-rosuvastatin|Med-rosuvastatin|Taro-rosuvastatin|Auro-rosuvastatin|Ach-rosuvastatin|Ipg-rosuvastatin|Rosuvastatin|Jamp Rosuvastatin Calcium|Crestor - 5mg|Ag-rosuvastatin|Priva-rosuvastatin|Apo-rosuvastatin|Mint-rosuvastatin|PMS-rosuvastatin|Novo-rosuvastatin|Riva-rosuvastatin|Roszet|Dom-rosuvastatin|Teva-rosuvastatin|Act Rosuvastatin|Crestor - 20mg|Ag-rosuvastatin Calcium|Ezallor Sprinkle|Jamp-rosuvastatin|Crestor|Mylan-rosuvastatin|Prz-rosuvastatin|Q-rosuvastatin|Nra-rosuvastatin|Bio-rosuvastatin|M-rosuvastatin|Crestor - 10mg|Crestor - 40mg|Mar-rosuvastatin|Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe,2016-11-16|2016-11-08|2018-08-24|2017-05-02|2012-04-02|2019-05-23|2018-01-22|2019-02-14|2020-06-12|2020-06-01|2021-10-12|2022-07-20|2022-01-24|2021-05-10|2019-02-25|2019-12-10|2016-11-17|2020-08-25|2018-12-06|2021-06-29|2017-12-07|2019-01-24|2019-06-11|2017-11-22|2017-06-05|2016-05-23|2017-03-21|2019-05-21|2018-12-28|2012-07-11|2020-06-09|2013-11-27|2004-09-02|2013-10-23|2018-11-13|2019-09-11|2022-03-09|2022-07-28|2005-06-22|2012-06-13|2019-01-22|2016-10-10|2019-01-02|2018-12-14|2012-03-16|2019-08-19|2020-01-16|2022-05-09|2018-01-26|2018-12-20|2022-02-03|2016-06-30|2020-02-28|2018-10-22|2017-05-05|2021-07-21|2021-08-31|2017-02-02|2017-04-14|2022-05-18|2019-05-01|2018-01-05|2021-08-15|2010-11-09|2016-09-12|2012-07-19|2018-01-17|2012-04-17|2013-06-12|2012-09-24|2016-08-22|2019-06-27|2018-07-19|2012-06-11|2018-05-11|2017-03-24|2017-07-31|2013-09-28|2018-11-05|2016-08-16|2019-05-04|2016-06-29|2019-02-28|2016-09-26|2021-03-04|2014-06-26|2010-12-01|2004-11-01|2003-11-25|2022-09-14|2017-02-08|2011-07-21|2016-07-20|2004-06-07|2011-02-22|2016-05-02|2005-03-18|2021-02-05|2021-11-19|2020-12-01|2016-10-31|2019-02-12|2019-04-24|2021-02-08|2012-02-27|2005-04-14|2003-08-18|2018-09-30|2020-01-14|2019-05-07|2016-08-15|2018-01-08|2003-02-19|2017-05-15|2017-01-03|2021-03-01|2020-12-04|2016-04-13|2015-11-30|2016-09-21|2020-04-14|2012-03-15|2019-01-14|2017-08-29|2020-01-24|2005-10-26|2018-01-25|2018-10-26|2016-07-22|2016-10-18|2018-05-18|2021-02-18|2017-02-01|2016-07-19|2021-03-10|2018-12-11|2013-07-02|2022-01-22|2016-10-29|2016-08-18,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,"These highlights do not include all the information needed to use ROSUVASTATIN TABLETS safely and effectively.

Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].

Moreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with β-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer's disease [A175957].",246.354,CCN(CC)C(=O)C1(CC1CN)C1=CC=CC=C1,,G56VK1HF36,RNZ43O5WW5,Milnacipran HCl|Savella,2009-06-22|2009-04-17|2010-01-19|2014-01-31|2011-11-17,US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/8b720a1e-034b-4583-b80d-105a794cce74/spl-doc,Milnacipran,N06AX17,0.1,g,,

It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]

The drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]",287.3535,[H][C@]12C[C@@H](O)C=C[C@]11CCN(C)CC3=C1C(O2)=C(OC)C=C3,,0D3Q044KCA,MJ4PTD2VVW,Reminyl -(12mg)|Pat-galantamine ER|Razadyne|Galantamine ER|Reminyl -(8mg)|Reminyl ER|Teva-galantamine ER|Galantamine hydrobromide|PMS-galantamine|Auro-galantamine ER|Reminyl -(4mg)|Galantamine Hydrobromide|Pendo-galantamine ER|Galantamine|Mylan-galantamine ER|Mar-galantamine ER|Ratio-galantamine|Ipg-galantamine ER|Sandoz Galantamine ER|Apo-galantamine|PMS-galantamine ER,2001-08-08|2011-02-09|2008-10-14|2015-03-10|2004-12-24|2001-03-01|2005-04-29|2008-10-15|2001-08-10|2011-01-05|2012-11-05|2006-06-01|2013-06-13|2009-07-09|2017-08-02|2015-03-25|2009-11-09|2016-08-05|2010-01-01|2009-12-15|2009-05-27|2004-12-22|2015-02-25|2014-06-11|2008-08-28|2008-12-15|2014-06-12|2012-01-06|2009-08-14|2001-02-28|2008-08-29|2013-12-03|2010-02-19|2016-06-01|2016-01-11|2010-11-12|2015-09-02|2001-06-22|2011-03-29|2011-01-24|2013-06-12|2011-10-10|2009-05-29,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/56f365e5-0a23-4f69-e054-00144ff8d46c/spl-doc?hl=Galantamine,Galantamine,N06DA04,16,mg,,

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Olmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Olmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912]

Ramipril may be used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, nephropathy, and to reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events.",416.5106,[H][C@@]12CCC[C@]1([H])N([C@@H](C2)C(O)=O)C(=O)[C@H](C)N[C@@H](CCC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)OCC,2.9,L35JN3I7SJ,,Prv-ramipril|Mylan-ramipril|Ag-ramipril|Act Ramipril|Priva-ramipril|Apo-ramipril|Bio-ramipril|Ramipril-10|Pro-ramipril - 1.25|Pharma-ramipril|Apo-ramipril/hctz|Altace Plus Felodipine 5mg + 5mg|Ramipril-2.5|Altace|Ava-ramipril|Ramipril|Teva-ramipril|Auro-ramipril|Jamp-ramipril|Ipg-ramipril|Ramipril Capsules|Mar-ramipril|Van-ramipril|Sandoz Ramipril|Ach-ramipril|Altace Cap 1.25mg|Ramipril-5|Taro-ramipril|Rbx-ramipril|Taro-ramipril Hctz|Teva-ramipril/hctz|Pro-ramipril - 2.5|Mint-ramipril|PMS-ramipril-hctz|Ntp-ramipril|Pro-ramipril - 10|Altace Cap 2.5mg|Altace HCT|Ramace|Ratio-ramipril|Altace Cap 5mg|Altace Cap 10mg|Nra-ramipril|Pro-ramipril - 5|Ramipril-hctz|Dom-ramipril|PMS-ramipril|Altace Plus Felodipine 2.5mg + 2.5mg,2010-02-03|2007-12-26|2014-09-10|2017-12-05|2020-09-16|2009-05-01|2011-11-24|2007-07-05|2019-03-20|2016-01-13|2008-07-02|2005-03-08|2010-11-20|1997-04-21|2013-11-28|2010-03-01|2017-03-23|2006-11-16|2019-02-06|2016-11-07|2020-08-26|2015-02-12|2009-07-30|2020-03-19|2013-10-23|2014-11-24|2008-06-18|2016-02-12|2006-06-27|2015-09-08|2020-01-16|2018-09-06|2020-05-28|2020-02-28|2010-05-24|2017-12-15|1993-12-31|2019-09-09|1997-05-28|2020-05-27|2020-02-25|2011-11-25|2019-09-20|2014-05-07|2021-03-03|2008-07-23|2018-07-19|2017-09-07|2013-03-12|2008-03-17|2017-08-17|2016-01-27|2008-03-14|2011-06-08|2008-06-27|1996-08-19|2018-05-15|2008-07-07|2012-09-13|2018-04-16|2009-10-06|2013-10-10|2008-01-22|1991-01-28|2014-01-13|2015-01-01|2010-03-10|2011-08-22|2015-06-17|2019-10-29|2010-06-01|2015-01-09|2006-12-12|2007-10-02|2005-09-13|2009-03-06|2006-08-14|2008-02-13|2007-01-09|1997-03-24|2010-05-11|2008-07-14|2015-05-07|2017-08-18|2008-06-09|2014-12-30|2018-05-14|2008-06-25|2007-12-24|2011-01-01|2009-05-05|2008-10-01|2000-07-27|2002-08-12|2011-09-19|2007-05-02|2008-06-24|2007-02-27|2008-06-20|2020-01-10|2008-06-10|2014-01-01|2008-02-21|2006-01-14|2017-10-13|2020-06-15|2006-12-13|2014-03-17,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/245d3580-77c6-4c0f-b324-c8514b792c59/spl-doc?hl=Ramipril ,Ramipril,C09AA05,2.5,mg,,

related to rheumatic diseases, and has a well studied adverse effect profile.[A179098] Given its overall tolerability and effectiveness, naproxen can be considered a first line treatment for a variety of clinical situations requiring analgesia.[A179098] Naproxen is available in both immediate and delayed release formulations, in combination with sumatriptan to treat migraines, and in combination with esomeprazole to lower the risk of developing gastric ulcers.[L6582][L6583][L7309][L7312]",230.2592,COC1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(C=C2)[C@H](C)C(O)=O,3.18,57Y76R9ATQ,9TN87S3A3C,Flanax Pain Relief

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, clomipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, clomipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as clomipramine, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Clomipramine may be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder). Unlabeled indications include panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy, autistic disorder, trichotillomania, onchophagia, stuttering, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Clomipramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and demethylated in the liver to its primary active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine.",314.852,CN(C)CCCN1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC2=C1C=C(Cl)C=C2,5.19,NUV44L116D,2LXW0L6GWJ,Clomipramine Tablets 25mg|Gen-clomipramine - Tab 50mg|Clomipramine-25 - Tab 25mg|Dom-clomipramine|Med Clomipramine Tablets - 50mg|Clomipramine Tablets 10mg|PMS-clomipramine|Act Clomipramine|Apo-clomipramine|Taro-clomipramine|Anafranil|Novo-clopamine Tab 10mg|Novo-clopamine Tablets - 25mg|Penta-clomipramine - 25mg|Gen-clomipramine - Tab 25mg|Clomipramine HCl|Clomipramine-10 - Tab 10mg|clomiPRAMINE Hydrochloride|Clomipramine-50 - Tab 50mg|Clomipramine hydrochloride|Clomipramine Hydrochloride|Med Clomipramine Tablets - 25mg|Altius-clomipramine|Gen-clomipramine - Tab 10mg|Penta-clomipramine - 50mg|Clomipramine Tablets 50mg|Novo-clopamine Tablets- 50mg,2020-12-23|2018-08-27|2014-09-10|1989-09-29|2020-09-01|1996-08-30|2015-06-01|2020-05-01|2020-05-17|2005-09-28|1994-12-31|1998-03-04|2021-07-01|2015-08-12|1995-12-31|1996-03-29|1998-04-30|2018-05-03|1998-05-11|2018-10-31|2020-05-07|2021-08-05|1997-01-06|1996-12-31|1993-12-31|2020-03-01|1973-12-31|1999-03-10|2020-11-01|2019-02-04|2020-07-27|1989-12-29|2019-12-01|2017-03-21|1981-12-31|2003-02-20|1997-06-25|1997-01-05|2014-08-29|2020-03-10|1975-12-31,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/bbf275df-2fe0-443c-99ca-2298721441dc/spl-doc?hl=Clomipramine ,Clomipramine,N06AA04,0.1,g,,

Gout is closely associated with hyperuricemia. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels.[A230548]

Zolpidem improves sleep in patients with insomnia. It is aimed for use in patients with difficulties initiating sleep. This drug decreases the time to fall asleep (sleep latency), increases the duration of sleep, and decreases the number of awakenings during sleep in patients with temporary (transient) insomnia.  It is available in both immediate acting and extended release forms [FDA label], [F3802]. 

Its tolerability profile is favorable when administered according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a low risk of drug withdrawal, drug dependence, and drug tolerance [A175426]. In addition, zolpidem improves sleep quality in patients suffering from chronic insomnia and can show mild muscle relaxant properties [L5584]. Research also shows that zolpidem is rapid and effective in restoring brain function for patients in a vegetative state following brain injury.

It is different from many other Alzheimer's Disease medications, as it works by a different mechanism than the cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors normally employed in the management of Alzheimer's disease [A1639].  Memantine blocks the effects of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain that leads to neuronal excitability and excessive stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease [T556].

In 2010, it was estimated that 36 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2013, this number increased to 44 million.

Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]

Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]",263.381,COC1=CC=CC(=C1)C1(O)CCCCC1CN(C)C,1.34,39J1LGJ30J,9N7R477WCK,Rybix ODT|Tramadol HCl ER|Nra-tramadol/acet|Tramadol Hydrochloride ER|Synapryn|Mar-tramadol|Tramadol HCL ER|Apo-tramadol|Bio-tramadol/acet|Ag-acet-tramadol|Tramadol Hydrchloride|Tridural|Sandoz Tramadol|Lupin-tramadol/acet|Teva-tramadol/acetaminophen|Jamp Tramadol HCl|Mar-tramadol/acet|Tramadol hydrochloride|Theratramadol-90|Act Tramadol/acet|Seglentis|Tramadol HCl|Ryzolt|Theratramadol-60|Apo-tramadol/acet|Jamp Tramadol|Mylan-tramadol/acet|Ultram ER|Mint-tramadol/acet|Tramadol ER|Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended Release|Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen|Tramadol Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen|Pat-tramadol/acet|ConZip|Tramapap|Taro-tramadol ER|Ralivia|Tramadol HCl and Acetaminophen|Taro-tramadol/acet|Jamp-acet-tramadol|Tramadol/acet|Ultracet|Qdolo|Ipg-tramadol/acet|Auro-tramadol/acetaminophen|Durela|Tramadol HCL|Ultram|Auro-tramadol|Tramacet|Riva-tramadol/acet|Tramadol Hydrochloride|Tramadol / Acetaminophen|Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release|Tramadol Acetaminophen|Tramaphen-odan|Priva-tramadol/acet|Tramadol|Zytram XL|PMS-tramadol-acet|Tramadol-acet|Topical Pain,2020-09-01|2006-12-07|2005-04-15|2012-09-04|2018-01-09|2014-07-25|2022-01-12|2005-05-12|2015-11-24|2010-05-01|2020-06-12|2013-05-07|2020-06-01|2016-06-15|2011-08-31|2021-04-21|2018-06-13|2014-08-19|2015-02-25|2017-05-01|2010-11-17|2009-11-13|2010-03-01|2011-12-09|2010-08-13|2012-11-27|1999-02-10|2016-09-20|2017-11-22|2015-09-18|2020-09-25|2014-12-23|2009-06-19|2019-01-01|2011-12-05|2017-07-01|2020-11-10|2008-12-30|2017-01-12|2015-10-01|2011-02-16|2005-05-05|2014-11-20|2014-11-14|2014-12-12|2010-07-31|2019-08-09|2010-03-23|2008-11-24|2011-12-27|2015-05-22|2016-12-12|2019-02-15|2014-11-11|2011-01-30|2001-08-30|2011-05-20|2022-03-11|2001-08-15|2015-06-22|2012-12-15|2011-03-02|2013-07-09|2020-02-13|2012-03-19|2022-01-05|2005-09-08|2016-02-10|2022-12-05|2017-04-01|2002-06-21|2009-11-09|2022-01-01|2014-04-02|2019-07-18|2020-02-28|2015-04-08|2010-01-01|2014-02-26|2011-09-20|2017-05-03|2014-08-05|2012-03-14|2010-02-26|2016-03-16|2015-09-22|2017-12-15|2008-12-15|2014-08-30|2013-04-29|2019-04-11|2020-07-22|2018-06-15|2009-12-17|2015-10-14|2015-01-30|2006-05-02|2017-10-23|2010-03-08|2013-10-06|2019-10-31|2019-04-08|2016-10-25|2014-02-20|2012-10-15|2009-10-27|2009-10-19|2020-02-24|2021-03-26|2013-09-27|2005-04-21|2022-03-28|2015-01-14|2020-02-06|2016-08-22|2017-12-04|2008-10-09|2015-04-01|2012-09-18|2021-01-29|2009-06-30|2015-07-09|2016-12-01|2016-02-23|2019-09-24|2016-04-06|2017-10-03|2012-06-28|2014-08-18|2010-04-07|2002-06-25|2016-02-25|2014-02-03|2015-01-13|2020-06-24|2021-04-22|2012-04-30|2009-09-14|2013-06-04|2002-10-30|2015-01-01|2022-09-14|2020-09-23|2014-02-14|2012-09-05|2016-05-10|2006-08-23|2015-07-01|2013-02-07|2013-05-13|2021-09-02|2014-04-07|2002-07-10|2012-05-01|2016-05-27|2017-02-23|2019-03-12|2011-12-12|2002-06-19|2018-11-15|2015-04-15|2014-06-23|2020-04-06|2011-06-01|2011-05-19|2012-10-01|2011-01-01|2020-09-11|2012-08-14|2012-07-17|2017-12-12|2022-12-23|2016-07-15|2012-03-20|2017-01-03|2002-08-01|2011-12-30|2017-08-24|2020-07-01|2005-10-01|2018-08-28|2010-11-15|2007-03-30|2014-03-31|2011-01-31|1995-03-03|2014-02-13|2019-05-03|2002-06-20|2020-07-23|2015-10-07|2014-01-01|2017-03-22|2015-10-20|2020-01-30|2022-05-12|2014-01-09|2005-12-16|2005-07-22|2012-06-27|2011-02-04|2002-06-22|2011-09-26|2020-01-01|2018-03-01|2007-08-14|2010-06-28|2012-03-01|2016-03-07|2019-01-17|2014-10-06|2011-02-07|2009-11-23|2015-03-27|2007-10-25|2012-03-09|2006-01-16,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Non-Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/f5ca9de8-2f03-1578-e053-2a95a90add47/spl-doc?hl=tramadol%20hydrochloride ,Tramadol,N02AX02,0.3,g,,

One of the most common uses for this drug is for a condition called _allergic rhinitis_. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is associated with multiple missed or unproductive days at work and school, problems with sleep, and other difficulties with day to day activities for many individuals [A175057]. Furthermore, some antihistamine agents that are used to treat this condition cause undesirable, sedating effects [A175060]. 

Cetirizine is one of the first second-generation H1 antihistamines (SGAHs) formulated to selectively inhibit the H1 receptor without sedating effects

It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. 

In HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and [DB00008] results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6.

It is the prodrug form of isavuconazole, the active moiety, and it is available in oral and parenteral formulations. Due to low solubility in water of isavuconazole on its own, the isovuconazonium formulation is favorable as it has high solubility in water and allows for intravenous administration. This formulation also avoids the use of a cyclodextrin vehicle for solubilization required for intravenous administration of other antifungals such as voriconazole and posaconazole, eliminating concerns of nephrotoxicity associated with cyclodextrin. Isovuconazonium has excellent oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and a good safety profile, making it a reasonable alternative to its few other competitors on the market.",717.77,[H]C(C)(OC(=O)N(C)C1=C(COC(=O)CNC)C=CC=N1)[N+]1=CN(C[C@](O)(C2=C(F)C=CC(F)=C2)[C@@]([H])(C)C2=NC(=CS2)C2=CC=C(C=C2)C#N)N=C1,,VH2L779W8Q,31Q44514JV,Cresemba,2015-03-06|2019-05-02|2015-11-04|2022-11-22|2019-05-31,Canada|US,Non-Nephrotoxic,,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/8f7f73b8-586a-4df0-935f-fecd4696c16c/spl-doc?hl=Isavuconazonium ,Isavuconazonium,N/A,See Dosage Label Dosage Notes,See Dosage Label Dosage Notes,,N/A

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Telaprevir. Telaprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Telaprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022].

Telaprevir, [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] were used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily administration of the combination therapy followed by 12 or 36 weeks of therapy with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022]. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].

Telaprevir was available as a fixed dose product (tradename Incivek) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in May 2011 by the FDA, Incivek was indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 in combination with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] [FDA Label].

Although it was initially developed as an independent antiviral agent, it has been shown to possess advantageous properties in combination regimens with low-dose ritonavir and other protease inhibitors. It is now more commonly used as a booster of other protease inhibitors and is available in both liquid formulations and as capsules. 

While ritonavir is not an active antiviral agent against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, it is added in combination therapies indicated for the treatment of HCV infections as a booster. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as [DB09297] and overall drug exposure. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend ritonavir-boosted combination therapies as first-line therapy for HCV Genotype 1a/b and 4 treatment-naïve patients with or without cirrhosis. 

Ritonavir is found in a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB09297] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.

Ritonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296] and [DB09297] as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with Ribavirin for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.

In Canada, ritonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB09297] as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak. First approved in January 2015, Holkira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b with or without cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with or without cirrhosis. The inclusion of ritonavir can select for HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions. Any HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with ritonavir-containing combination therapies should also be on a suppressive antiretroviral drug regimen to reduce the risk of HIV-1 protease inhibitor drug resistance.

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 [A174175].

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]",748.9845,CC[C@H]1OC(=O)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@H]2C[C@@](C)(OC)[C@@H](O)[C@H](C)O2)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@@H]2O[C@H](C)C[C@@H]([C@H]2O)N(C)C)[C@](C)(O)C[C@@H](C)CN(C)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O)[C@]1(C)O,3.03,J2KLZ20U1M,5FD1131I7S,"Zithromax - Pws Orl 100mg/5ml|Novo-azithromycin Pediatric|Ag-azithromycin|M-azithromycin|Pro-azithromycine|Act Azithromycin|Apo-azithromycin|Ipg-azithromycin|Azithromycin for Injection USP|Azithromycin for Injection, USP|Azithromycin for Injection|Mylan-azithromycin|Azithromycin Dihydrate|PMS-azithromycin|Ratio Azithromycin|Zithromax 600mg|Nra-azithromycin|Azithromycin Monohydrate|Gd-azithromycin|Azithromycin monohydrate|Mylan-azithromycin for Injection|Apo-azithromycin Z|PHL-azithromycin|Sandoz Azithromycin|Auro-azithromycin|Azasite|Riva Azithromycin|Zmax SR|Zithromax Cap 250mg|Azithromycin dihydrate|Mar-azithromycin|Zithromax|Zmax|Ava-azithromycin|AzaSITE|Riva-azithromycin|Jamp-azithromycin|Teva-azithromycin|Dom-azithromycin|AzaSite|Azithromycin|Zithromax for Intravenous Injection",2016-11-16|2019-10-30|2006-08-01|2015-03-02|2022-11-01|1997-07-21|2017-11-13|2006-03-20|2018-08-06|2015-06-19|1999-08-27|2014-11-13|2018-09-26|2022-01-12|2009-05-01|2021-10-18|2019-05-17|2013-11-04|2022-09-05|2010-02-01|2010-12-28|2016-11-13|2021-05-13|2006-04-19|2014-03-07|2021-01-20|2022-08-08|2017-03-02|2013-08-09|2019-07-01|2020-10-15|2006-08-03|2005-11-02|2017-02-13|2020-02-04|2006-01-04|2015-02-01|2019-07-24|2020-12-11|2011-12-21|2013-11-20|2017-09-14|2017-10-12|2017-03-23|2006-08-17|2015-02-27|2015-01-15|2017-07-01|2019-07-04|2017-05-09|2017-09-27|2019-03-01|2019-12-11|2013-10-21|2018-12-26|2017-01-24|2010-12-17|1999-02-12|2017-10-25|1999-03-23|2018-11-30|2015-04-23|2010-11-11|2020-05-01|2016-12-31|2011-05-20|2010-03-24|2017-01-06|2018-06-12|2005-11-11|2020-02-13|2018-12-19|2018-07-05|2021-07-22|2017-03-20|2020-01-29|2018-12-20|2009-11-09|2014-05-14|2020-02-28|2008-09-22|2005-11-14|2013-07-19|2014-10-07|2019-04-16|2020-05-15|2011-07-13|2021-08-31|2022-11-17|2012-01-10|2020-05-12|2017-06-28|1996-09-26|2008-10-27|2017-02-02|2021-10-08|2021-01-19|2019-05-01|2005-12-01|2019-09-17|2008-02-11|2017-10-23|2014-03-19|2009-06-10|2010-11-09|2018-01-03|2020-04-30|2022-07-18|2015-07-22|2014-02-20|2015-10-19|2012-07-19|2020-03-20|2013-12-04|2020-06-18|2018-04-10|2019-06-27|2018-01-12|2020-03-10|2017-09-07|2010-09-22|2017-01-01|2020-07-15|2021-09-10|2019-12-30|2002-07-18|2022-09-09|2013-12-02|2009-06-26|2022-01-10|2015-08-11|2015-08-18|2012-04-26|1994-12-31|2017-02-16|2014-02-17|2018-08-10|2017-09-13|2008-09-08|2011-03-10|1995-08-15|2020-04-18|2022-12-20|2002-05-24|2009-09-01|2015-01-01|2011-10-24|2010-08-09|1997-01-01|2009-09-08|2016-04-14|2013-05-13|2008-12-24|2005-11-23|2007-08-17|2016-05-27|2020-04-23|2013-09-13|2017-02-22|2006-01-06|2019-03-12|2020-05-22|1995-06-10|2022-08-25|2019-03-15|2006-09-18|2018-11-15|1996-07-18|2007-07-16|2008-04-16|2014-02-06|2016-09-29|2014-10-13|2010-04-25|2019-08-30|2012-07-21|2019-05-07|2017-08-25|2009-12-10|2006-12-19|2018-04-19|2011-07-18|2017-03-08|1999-06-09|2008-05-30|2011-09-19|2007-08-10|2011-01-12|2020-04-10|2015-04-16|2022-04-11|1995-10-19|2016-03-02|2021-11-17|2011-10-04|2007-07-27|2008-06-24|2022-05-17|2006-05-04|2008-04-02|2016-10-20|2020-02-12|2005-11-16|2015-04-07|2006-02-08|2011-11-11|2019-11-19|2014-03-06|2012-10-08|2021-10-23|2021-04-23|1994-09-28|2012-03-29|2012-07-18|2018-10-09|2019-07-10|2012-07-02|2014-01-01|2019-05-13|2018-07-23|2022-08-29|2006-03-16|2015-10-27|2016-12-28|2009-10-14|1997-01-30|2010-05-28|2020-01-28|1996-06-12|2020-06-15|2011-12-29|2016-10-12|2014-03-26,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/f5c6bcdd-83fa-be66-e053-2995a90a0fe3/spl-doc?hl=Azithromycin ,Azithromycin,J01FA10,0.3,g,,

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]",558.6398,CC(C)C1=C(C(=O)NC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=C(N1CC[C@@H](O)C[C@@H](O)CC(O)=O)C1=CC=C(F)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1,6.36,A0JWA85V8F,C0GEJ5QCSO,Jamp-atorvastatin|Amlodipine besylate and Atorvastatin calcium|Atorvastatin Calcium|Atorvastatin-10|Ntp-atorvastatin|Pmsc-atorvastatin|Apo-amlodipine-atorvastatin|Atorvastatin-80|Caduet|Riva-atorvastatin|Mar-atorvastatin|Ava-atorvastatin|Jamp Atorvastatin Tablets|Jamp Atorvastatin Calcium|Atorvastatin-20|Taro-atorvastatin|Ag-atorvastatin|Dengue Kill|Apo-atorvastatin|Atorvastatin calcium|M-atorvastatin|Amlodipine and atorvastatin|Ach-atorvastatin Calcium|Mint-atorvastatin|Atorvastatin|Bio-atorvastatin|Priva-atorvastatin|Reddy-atorvastatin|Pdp-atorvastatin|Teva-atorvastatin|Q-gen Atorvastatin|Auro-atorvastatin|Liptruzet|Atorvastatin-40|Amlodipine besylate/atorvastatin calcium|Ratio-atorvastatin|Pendo-amlodipine-atorvastatin|Mylan-atorvastatin|Prz-atorvastatin|Atorvastatin Calcium (Amorphous)|Lypqozet|PMS-amlodipine-atorvastatin|PMS-atorvastatin|Amlodipine Besylate and Atorvastatin Calcium|Rbx-atorvastatin|Mylan-amlodipine/atorvastatin|Amlodipine and Atorvastatin|Nra-atorvastatin|Lipitor|Novo-atorvastatin|Coffeerazzi Minerang Dutchcoffee|Gd-atorvastatin|Gd-amlodipine/atorvastatin|Sandoz Atorvastatin|Dom-atorvastatin,2006-01-11|2015-03-02|2012-03-08|2022-11-01|2010-05-19|1996-12-17|2018-08-06|2022-08-17|2014-01-29|2014-10-10|2019-05-23|2013-02-14|2021-05-14|2013-06-13|2020-09-24|2013-01-07|2013-10-02|2020-06-01|2020-10-13|2005-01-18|2013-09-19|2013-08-09|2019-03-25|2013-04-05|2013-05-03|2011-02-10|2022-09-30|2014-10-31|2021-10-06|2020-03-13|2011-11-30|2011-12-01|2021-11-10|2016-09-19|2022-06-06|2015-04-02|2020-01-15|2019-01-01|2005-09-14|2017-11-10|2018-08-02|2017-11-16|2022-01-23|2017-05-09|2012-06-26|2020-08-26|1997-03-11|2017-11-20|2017-11-01|2017-10-05|2010-12-17|2012-05-30|2013-08-21|2019-10-22|2016-01-29|2013-10-23|2021-01-14|2019-03-11|2016-12-05|2006-11-02|2019-01-21|2010-10-23|2013-11-15|2019-10-21|2015-06-22|2018-04-24|2016-08-04|2013-07-09|2010-05-20|2018-09-17|2004-12-27|2018-06-18|2022-02-03|2020-07-31|2022-07-25|2017-05-19|2018-09-27|2011-11-28|2014-06-01|2022-11-29|1997-03-05|2012-03-14|2022-08-31|2017-12-15|2013-07-05|2017-04-26|2022-01-06|2022-03-23|2014-11-06|2018-10-25|2018-11-21|2014-06-24|2006-09-21|2011-12-06|2019-07-08|2021-12-15|2016-12-02|2013-08-25|1997-05-05|2018-10-10|2011-10-17|2022-03-18|2016-10-17|2012-12-27|2021-03-03|2019-04-15|2021-02-15|2014-11-01|2014-01-23|2020-01-17|2020-03-05|2019-01-10|2011-12-02|2010-05-27|2013-01-28|2018-12-01|2017-11-15|2015-05-11|2005-12-23|2004-01-30|2013-03-26|2014-01-15|2021-01-26|2018-10-05|2020-01-21|2016-05-19|2018-07-20|2012-09-10|2013-11-05|2013-05-15|2013-07-29|2019-09-24|2019-02-28|2016-09-26|2021-03-16|2014-10-16|2014-06-19|2009-04-15|2013-01-01|2014-10-08|2017-01-31|2021-08-01|2022-02-01|2012-01-02|2018-09-01|2019-05-30|2017-04-25|2014-02-11|2010-12-01|2021-09-20|2016-07-12|2021-06-01|2013-06-04|2021-08-30|2017-05-04|2015-01-01|2018-02-17|2020-03-30|2018-10-31|2021-07-28|2020-07-07|2004-03-12|2019-03-28|2017-11-29|2020-02-14|2018-03-23|2018-09-25|2005-01-12|2010-06-01|2015-12-14|2021-12-22|2014-05-21|2020-10-27|2017-08-18|2018-01-01|2014-01-30|2022-12-21|2015-12-21|2016-06-28|2022-09-19|2020-04-17|1998-06-08|2021-03-08|2010-05-21|2021-09-11|2000-04-07|2012-03-05|2017-05-12|2013-03-28|2018-02-13|2020-07-29|2018-12-23|2013-01-16|2019-02-08|2010-04-29|2012-07-17|2016-12-27|2017-01-03|2018-04-01|2017-02-15|2018-07-25|2017-02-03|2013-07-08|2014-06-03|2021-10-01|2014-04-20|2018-11-09|2022-03-14|2014-04-28|2013-06-18|2011-07-25|2021-11-24|2000-07-06|2016-09-01|2014-03-11|2018-05-16|2018-03-07|2017-04-03|2013-01-21|2017-04-05|2018-04-30|2018-01-25|2015-03-05|2021-08-05|2001-06-29|2021-11-23|2022-11-08|2013-05-14|2014-04-25|2014-01-01|2015-08-25|2014-04-04|2016-09-14|2013-04-15|2009-11-30|2014-03-20|2020-08-20|2018-03-01|2020-01-01|2020-01-18|2022-08-29|2015-04-20|2016-02-16|2012-11-09|2020-04-21|2020-03-18|2012-05-29|2019-05-06|2018-03-26|2017-06-06|2019-10-18|2004-11-11|2014-04-03|2020-01-28|2002-04-08|2012-01-16|2021-11-22|2014-03-17|2019-01-18,Canada|US,,nephrotoxic,Nephrotoxic,http://fdalabel.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/set-ids/01eadde8-37f3-4474-995f-22c1a65adf12/spl-doc ,Atorvastatin,C10AA05,20,mg,,
